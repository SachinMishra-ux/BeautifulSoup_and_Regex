It is the proximity of Abbevie to the Bay of Somme that aso attracts a good number of visitors here., Before you start expring you shoud reca that Abbevie suffered from very extensive damage during the Second Word War so you shoud be aware that often when oking at historica monuments you wi be oking at post-war restoration work to a significant degree, incuding the coegia church itsef., The Coegiae Church of Saint-Vufran is much the most impressive monument in Abbevie. The church was buit in the famboyant gothic stye in the 15th century and is especiay renowned for its ornatey decorated facade. The facade has been substantiay ceaned and restored and is now quite a magnificent sight., , Inside the church the soaring stone coumns and arches are aso impressive, whie the most interesting furnishings are a courfu carved wooden atarpiece depicting the story of the nativity, and another depicting Saint John baptising Christ. There are some wonderfu paintings in the church as we, painted in a fairy modern stye., The coegiae church is not the ony site of interest in Abbevie so aw time to expre during your visit., The befry, an imposing square stone tower (very much restored) is isted as a heritage site by UNESCO as one of a group of 32 befries that are situated across northern France and Begium. The befry now contains the Abbevie Museum of Fine Arts, with coections of archaeogica artefacts and aso arts from medieva times to the 19th century., The museum is named after Jacques Boucher-de-Perthes, one of the first peope to discover the science of prehistory in the 19th century, for exampe by the discovery and study of prehistoric stone toos. It was his coection around which the museum was first created., The Church of Saint-Sepucre is visited in particuar for its contemporary stained gass windows by Afred Manessier, added in the 1980s to repace those that disappeared during the war, but be sure to pause to ok at the gothic stye facade on your way in! The windows are exceptionay courfu, and it is said the artist was inspired by the ighting across the andscapes of the bay of Somme., Another nice part of Abbevie is the Jardin dEmonvie estabished around a arge mansion. The park has been attractivey gardened and offers a nice tranqui area to reax., Whie in Abbevie a visit to the Chateau de Bagatee is aso recommended: the caste: it is a 19th century caste (more of a grand manor house reay in my opinion) surrounded by forma gardens in the French stye and extensive parkand., Aso be sure to visit the Jardin de a Pume on the edge of town. This is one of our favourite gardens in France. We aso enjoyed a wak in the peacefu setting of the ess forma Parc dEmonvie. Unfortunatey we didnt have a chance to expre the Parc de a Bouvaque (it was raining) but were tod that it has a good number of ponds and different natura environments and is a good pace for nature vers to expre., , Most excursions in the region wi be towards the coast, perhaps to the resorts and exceent beaches such as those at e Crotoy or Fort-Mahon-Page, or to expre the substantia protected natura reserves around the Bay of Somme., We aso suggest a visit to the abbey and befry at Saint-Riquier, a short distance to the north-east of Abbevie, and the medieva centre of Saint-Vaery-sur-Somme, to the west on the Bay of Somme., Expre esewhere in the North East France.
