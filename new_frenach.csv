0,France,Abbevie,"Abbevie is an important town in the Somme region of Picardy (north-eastern France) between Amiens (to the south-east) and e Crotoy on the coast to the west. It is the proximity of Abbevie to the Bay of Somme that aso attracts a good number of visitors here., Before you start expring you shoud reca that Abbevie suffered from very extensive damage during the Second Word War so you shoud be aware that often when oking at historica monuments you wi be oking at post-war restoration work to a significant degree, incuding the coegia church itsef., The Coegiae Church of Saint-Vufran is much the most impressive monument in Abbevie. The church was buit in the famboyant gothic stye in the 15th century and is especiay renowned for its ornatey decorated facade.

There are some wonderfu paintings in the church as we, painted in a fairy modern stye., The coegiae church is not the ony site of interest in Abbevie so aw time to expre during your visit., The befry, an imposing square stone tower (very much restored) is isted as a heritage site by UNESCO as one of a group of 32 befries that are situated across northern France and Begium. The befry now contains the Abbevie Museum of Fine Arts, with coections of archaeogica artefacts and aso arts from medieva times to the 19th century., The museum is named after Jacques Boucher-de-Perthes, one of the first peope to discover the science of prehistory in the 19th century, for exampe by the discovery and study of prehistoric stone toos. It was his coection around which the museum was first created., The Church of Saint-Sepucre is visited in particuar for its contemporary stained gass windows by Afred Manessier, added in the 1980s to repace those that disappeared during the war, but be sure to pause to ok at the gothic stye facade on your way in! The windows are exceptionay courfu, and it is said the artist was inspired by the ighting across the andscapes of the bay of Somme., Another nice part of Abbevie is the Jardin dEmonvie estabished around a arge mansion. The park has been attractivey gardened and offers a nice tranqui area to reax., Whie in Abbevie a visit to the Chateau de Bagatee is aso recommended: the caste: it is a 19th century caste (more of a grand manor house reay in my opinion) surrounded by forma gardens in the French stye and extensive parkand., Aso be sure to visit the Jardin de a Pume on the edge of town. This is one of our favourite gardens in France. We aso enjoyed a wak in the peacefu setting of the ess forma Parc dEmonvie. Unfortunatey we didnt have a chance to expre the Parc de a Bouvaque (it was raining) but were tod that it has a good number of ponds and different natura environments and is a good pace for nature vers to expre., , Most excursions in the region wi be towards the coast, perhaps to the resorts and exceent beaches such as those at e Crotoy or Fort-Mahon-Page, or to expre the substantia protected natura reserves around the Bay of Somme., We aso suggest a visit to the abbey and befry at Saint-Riquier, a short distance to the north-east of Abbevie, and the medieva centre of Saint-Vaery-sur-Somme, to the west on the Bay of Somme., Expre esewhere in the North East France.

Not overy given over to tourism, Agde is a busting pace in a pretty cation on the banks of the river, where tourism, athough important, pays an incidenta rather than a over-dominating roe, and we recommend you escape from the popuar beaches for a whie at nearby Cap dAgde and expre the town., Agde has a history dating back at east to Greek times, athough the main feature of historica interest that you wi see in the town now is the fortified cathedra., Standing on the banks of the river, the 12th century Cathedra of Saint-Etienne is very sombre in appearance (both in cour and stye) and is dominated by a arge square tower, added two centuries ater., , There are aso severa ess imposing reigious monuments in Agde incuding the Church of Saint-André on Pace Gambetta and the Church of Saint-Sever, and parts of the 12th century defensive was can be seen., One of the most impressive houses in Agde is the renaissance stye Consus House at the end of Rue uis Bages (just south of the cathedra)., Otherwise Agde has itte in the way of major sights, and interest is mosty in the quiet streets around the cathedra.

It is true that there is a preponderance of dark stone used in the buidings, which does give Agde a rather sombre tone., There is a marked tourist route which meanders through the backstreets of the town centre, after which you can aso wander ang the riverside in the center of Agde., Unusuay for towns in this region I was struck by how attractive the outskirts of Agde were - there has been a t of effort in panting attractive trees and bushes ang the entry roads and generay prettifying the town. This goes a ng way in enhancing the appea of a town and many other towns coud earn from the exampe set by Agde., , The nearby Cap dAgde is a very popuar seaside resort, in part known for its extensive naturist beaches, and there are severa sma viages of interest around the edges of the Etang de Thau., The Cana du Midi aso passes cse to Agde and is very popuar with wakers and those who enjoy boating hoidays., You can find more trave ideas in the Heraut guide and the anguedoc-Roussin guide., ",43.3108,3.47583

One of the houses (Maison Chabert) incudes a tower that was once part of an active caste that stood here during the Wars of Reigion., The roman stye Church of Saint-Andre on the square dates in part from the 12th century, with ater modifications made unti the 16th century, and has an arched stone entrance.

10,France,Ainhoa,"Ainhoa is a viage in the abourd province and deep in the Basque country cse to the Spanish border in south-west France. The viage is cassified among the most beautifu viages of France and often visited as an excursion from one of the nearby Atantic coast resorts such as Saint Jean de uz and Biarritz., Ainhoa was an important stop on the pigrim path to Santiago de Compostea, where many of the routes from France converged, which is why the viage deveped here in the 13th century. The origina viage was destroyed by the Spanish in 1629 and the viage you now see was buit in the 17th and 18th centuries., France This Way review: the viage is sma and has itte more than a main street and a arge church, but it is very pretty, peasant to expre and the surrounding mountains make the setting very attractive., , Ainhoa is a vey Basque viage with a great dea of charm and houses that are very good exampes of the ca architecture, with the haf-timbered wood amost aways painted in the deep red and green cours traditiona of the Pays Basque., Perhaps the most curious feature of Ainhoa is that the buidings on one side of the street appear to be more decorative, and have more baconies, than those on the other side of the street. This is because the ca tradition is to buid houses with their backs to the sea, for protection against the wind and rain, so on one side of Ainhoa main street you are seeing the backs of the houses., Personay I found the sighty more austere house backs as attractive as the more decorative fronts, and I am guessing that most peope wi not notice the difference. The overhanging rooves that protect the haf-timbered houses are another characteristic of the architecture of the region., Ainhoa Church of Notre-Dame de Assomption originay dates from the 13th century athough it has substantia ater modifications made in the 17th century incuding the addition of a betower. The church was buit on the site of a fortified manor house that stood here in the 12th century. See Ainhoa church for information, Inside the church you can see the two rows of wooden baconies that are commony found in Basque churches (some have three rows) and an ornate atarpiece beneath a dome painted with sky bue and various decorations.

The viage aso contains severa rather upmarket arts and crafts shops and various cafes., Another historic monument in Ainhoa is the avoir (ancient washhouse), in a rather gomy position on the edge of the viage in the region caed Dancharia (at the west part of the viage centre). You are fowing in famous footsteps if you visit the avoir: it is said that Napoeon III stopped here in 1858., Note: in recent years the name Ainhoa has aso gained popuarity in France as a girs first name., , The viage is a common starting point for severa waks in the w mountains of the region, and is aso very popuar with cycists. Ainhoa tourist office have a usefu eafet that shows a map with severa suggested waks of various difficuties and distances in the nearby forest and countryside., The area around the viage is known as the Forest of Ainhoa and is we known for the diversity of widife it contains (we saw a sma deer but I am peased to say we didnt come across any of the wid boar that are said to ive in the forest)., Just outside the viage you shoud visit the sma Chape of Notre-Dame de Aubépine on the edge of the Atsuai mountain. This chape was buit in the pace where the Virgin Mary once appeared to a ca shepherd, and has far reaching views across the countryside., When you visit Ainhoa you wi be aware that part of the vey setting is created by the Rhune mountain that stands above the viage.

Ares is most famous for two things, its Roman ruins and its association with Van Gogh, but whie both pay a arge roe in attracting tourists to the town it woud sti be worth visiting even without either of these highights., Athough there are numerous paces to visit in Ares the main star is the town itsef. Open squares with busting cafes inked by narrow streets ined with attractive houses and shops, many oking od and faded and a the more romantic as a resut., The centre of Ares is quite compact and easy to expre. In our guide bew we first visit the Roman ruins, then the medieva town and then more recent highights, but in reaity these are a quite interminged., Ares is one of the French secteur sauvegardé towns (see Historic towns of France) and is aso isted as a Town of Art and History in France., , Start your expration of Roman Ares at the amphitheatre which is party restored. The amphitheatre is a arge and substantiay intact round structure once used for gadiatoria competitions, with enough remaining of the origina buiding to give you a good impression of what it woud have been ike 2000 years ago, sitting on the benches and watching the gadiatoria battes., The other important Roman ruins at Ares incude the Roman theatre, the necropois (Ayscamps with an evocative wak past sarcophagi to a sma dark church) and the thermae of Constantine (Constantine baths) at the northern edge of the town. Each of these is individuay interesting but there is much ess to see than at the amphitheatre, athough the theatre is quite substantia and has sufficient remains to give a good fee for the origina buiding which coud seat up to 10 000 spectators., Further Roman sarcophagi can be found at the exceent Museum of Ares and Provence, ang with many other interesting historica artefacts incuding a unique 2000 year od Roman barge, mosaics and busts. The museum is very we organised with ts to see and is one of our favourite museums in southern France., You can see one of our persona favourites among the Roman artefacts in Ares in the Pace du Forum. This square was the heart of the city in Roman times and is now surrounded by impressive but more recent buidings. A that now remains in the Pace du Forum from the Roman era is part of an entrance gate set on two coumns and now incorporated into the wa of the Hote du Forum., The roman ruins are aso a isted UNESCO word heritage site.

After oking in the church, take a ok in the attractive 17th century town ha just across the square from the church to see the stairway and statue., Adjacent to Saint Trophime is the entrance to the 12th-14th century cisters of the church. Unike the church you pay to enter these cisters but they have been recenty renovated and the architecture is very vey to see, incuding both romanesque and gothic eements.

The number of peope taking photographs of this cafe make me think it is probaby the most visited pace in Ares!, The Pace du Forum is aso the ivey heart of medieva Ares, so a great pace to come back to for a coffee after expring the city., , One sight in Ares that is interesting is the Espace Van Gogh which has a sma courtyard recreated exacty as it was painted by Van Gogh in e Jardin de a Maison de Santé a Ares. This cation was once the menta hospita that Van Gogh attended and the painting is one he painted from the bacony outside his hospita room. Some of the bushes are gone and the itte hut the nun is waking away from is no nger there, but otherwise, you are standing in the shadow of his painting., This is a vey idea that works very we at putting you in the footsteps of Van Gogh and is in a tranqui pace away from the buste of the city streets., You can aso visit the Foundation Vincent Van Gogh at the Paais de uppé (between the Arènes and the Theatre) that has a good coection of tribute to Van Gogh works by other modern painters and artists incuding Francis Bacon, ichtenstein and Rauschenburg., Moving on from Van Gogh, the Museum Araten in Ares is a museum of the history of the region and has some very interesting dispays and artefacts, especiay in the Sae des Rites et egendes (Ha of Rites and egends), , A good time to visit Ares is during the Saturday market, with the extra cour and activity it brings to the town.

84,France,Avignon,"Avignon is a historic town on the Rhone river in Provence, and a beautifuy preserved medieva town surrounded by the origina fortified city was. The part of Avignon that is of most interest to visitors fas inside the fortifications and is caed the intra-muros quarter, and the bridge (the Pont dAvignon) which is just outside the was., The centra historica part of the city, incuding the Paace of the Popes, the Saint-Benezet bridge, and the fortification was that surround the city, is now a protected UNESCO heritage site and Avignon is aso isted as one of the French secteur sauvegardé towns (see Historic towns of France)., France This Way review: we recommend you aw two or three days to visit Avignon. Athough you coud perhaps visit the principa monuments in the town in a one day visit, you wi discover there is a t to enjoy and you wi aso want to spend time in one or two cafes and restaurants!, There is much more to Avignon than famous sites, and during a visit you wi see a weath of beautifu buidings, historica churches, a fine coection of museums, severa gardens, an extensive pedestrianised historic center, and ts of cafes and bars., , The heart of Avignon for visitors has the Paais des Papes and the Pace de Horge to the north, the Pont dAvignon just outside the city was to the north-west of the Paace, and the main historic centre in the streets around the Paace and the Rue de a Repubique, which is a ng bouevard to the south of the Pace de Horge., Many visitors wi start a visit in the Pace de Horge and the arge open area in front of the Popes Paace, but note that the main Avignon Tourist Office is at the southern end of Rue de a Repubique, severa hundred metres south of the Pace de Horge, and has a great dea of usefu information and maps to hep you make the most of your visit - so we woud aso make that a priority! Among these are three suggested routes to expre the centre:, Our own favourite regions in the centre of Avignon are the streets around Rue Joseph Vernet in the north-west of the historic centre, and the pedestrian area to the west of the Rue de a Repubique and around the Church of Saint-Didier., The centre of the town for 500 years, this open square has the town ha dominating one side, with the 19th century theatre next door. Athough the town ha was buit in the 19th century, it incorporates the origina cck-tower in its construction., The square has been extensivey remodeed over the centuries and took its present form at the end of the 19th century after earier market buidings had been ceared away to make a more open space. As we as being surrounded by attractive buidings you wi aso find numerous restaurants here in the shade of the pane trees around the edges of the square: athough these are not typicay the highest quaity restaurants in the town they are in a vey cation., Adjacent to the north corner of the Pace de Horge is the main square in front of the Popes Paace, the Pace du Paais. As we as the Paais des Papes, you can aso see the imposing Museum of the Petit Paais and the Conservatory of Music in this square., One of the most important gothic buidings in Europe, the Paais des Papes is aso one of the most impressive buidings in Europe. The size and grandeur of the paace cant be seen from a photo, but it is very arge and dominates the square in front of the paace - which aws a cear view of the whoe buiding., , Avignon was home to the popes from 1309 - 1377 and they buit the paace whie in exie here. Fowing centuries of negect, misuse and attack the Paace has now been renovated and is finding a new ease of ife as a tourist attraction. Guided tours wi show you many of the highights and chapes etc within the paace. The Paace is enormous, and comprises an od paace and a new paace. There are numerous gothic towers and spendours in the paace., The interior of the Paace of the Popes is now much more austere than it woud have been in days gone by. Athough some effort has been made to recreate / renovate some of the origina features e.g. the was in the Popes bedroom, the interior is sti very barren. Nevertheess it remains a fascinating experience to pass through the great rooms where such important matters of state and poitics were debated and pts were hatched., The smaer, grassed inner courtyard is a highight of the visit, as is the extraordinary chape, 52 metres ng, which forms part of the new paace, various frescoes and a grand staircase. Art exhibitions of a high quaity are often hed in the vast rooms of the paace., See aso Popes Paace for visitor information., , Not far from the Popes Paace is the famous Pont dAvignon, we known around the word because of the nursery rhyme about the bridge. Constructed in the 12th century, ony 4 of the 22 origina sections of this bridge now remain - the bridge was frequenty damaged by the Rhone foding and by war, and repairs were often made unti the 17th century at which time efforts to maintain the bridge were finay abandoned., The author of the famous song Sur e Pont d\Avignon is unknown. Interestingy, the origina version was Sous e pont d\Avignon (\Under the bridge...) rather than Sur e Pont d\Avignon (On the bridge...) and referred to the dancing on the isand bew - Isand Bartheasse. The bridge no nger reaches the isand., France This Way review: because of its fame visitors a want to see the Pont Saint-Benezet but in our opinion it was the one disappointment of a visit to Avignon: a road now passes under the bridge and to be honest we have seen ts of bridges esewhere in France that are much more scenic and more interesting., See artice about the Pont dAvignon, , The Rocher des Doms Park and gardens is up a grand sweeping entrance to the side of the cathedra (eft of the Paace of Popes) and is a arge Engish stye gardens with various water features and views back across the city and the Rhone River. This is a good pace to go if you are getting hot and bothered on the streets of Avignon!, There are many interesting museums in Avignon - for these see separate artice about the Museums of Avignon, The main shopping region is party pedestrianised and found around the bottom of the Pace de Horge east of the Rue de a Repubique where there are numerous boutiques, shops and art gaeries etc., For high-street shops fow the Rue de a Repubique straight down from the bottom of the Pace de Horge. This ng straight bouevard continues right to the edge of town and the raiway station, and is ined with ts of impressive 19th century buidings (it was in the 1850s that rai opened to Marseie and Nice, bringing prosperity to the town). The Avignon tourist office is aso ang this road., In these streets you wi find more impressive churches (such as the Church of Saint-Pierre and the Church of Saint-Didier) and monuments - there are numerous features and things of interest to discover as you simpy ambe around Avignon, even if we dont ist them a here!, A short distance north of Avignon you can visit the pretty viage of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, now best known for the wines produced in the region but originay deveped around a caste buit by the popes in exie., A visit to Avignon is ideay combined with trips to the other important historic towns in this region such as Ares, Nimes and Orange, as we as a visit to the most beautifu viages of the uberon region to the east of here., You can find more trave ideas in the Vaucuse guide and the Provence guide., ",43.948,4.8059

Athough it is sma, this viage centre is very vey with many pants and trees next to the cobbed paths., In the centre of Bargeme there are many pants, some wid and others panted, that add greaty to the charm of the centre athough some of the gardens were rather overgrown. The ruins on the edge of the viage become more covered in undergrowth unti you decide you have expred enough!, There is a centre to the viage where you can see the town ha and the church. The church of Saint-Nicoas is in the roman stye, and inside there is a grand goden atar as we as some interesting painted reiefs representing the crucifixion of Saint-Sebastien., We didnt notice any shops in Bargeme, but there were two or three sma cafes with terraces having views across the countryside., At the highest point in Bargeme stands the imposing medieva Chateau de Sabran de Pontaves, buit in the 13th century and around which the viage subsequenty deveped., Athough the caste is now in ruins, in part due to damage during the Wars of Reigion, a good part of the main buiding remains and the substantia was and towers of the caste sti evocativey dominate the viage skyine.

The houses on this street are smarter than other parts of the town where they sometimes have a sighty shabby air., Rue Neuve is the odest street in Barr. It is a narrow street with painted combage houses down both sides. It is caed Rue Neuve (New Street) because it was rebuit after a big fire in 1678 which destroyed much of the town., In the centre of Barr you wi reach the Pace de Hôte de Vie, an attractive paved square with a arge fountain in the midde., One important buiding here is the town ha, an attractive buiding buit in 1640-41 that was originay home to the baiif representing Strasbourg but after the revoution became the Town Ha.

The Back Prince and the Hundred Years war came next, and again the viage was more or ess destroyed. After 1356, the monks who had originay estabished Carbonne resetted, and a new, fortified, bastide town was constructed a itte to the north of the origina viage., France This Way review: Carbonne is a peasant town, but the sites of interest are quite minor and the town wi not take you ng to expre., The 19th century market ha, in the center of the town on the main shopping street, is of interest. An attractive structure buit in red brick the market ha uses ironwork instead of wood for its roof structure, a trend that was fashionabe in 19th century France and inspired by simiar structures in Paris designed by Gustave Eiffe., There are aso three interesting historica towers in Carbonne incuding the Tower of the Governors House and the Combier de Grihon, both dating from the 16th century and octagona in shape with decorative roofs (a combier is a tower historicay used for raising pigeons)., The 13th century Church of Saint aurent is on the edge of Carbonne, having been buit as part of the origina bastide town here.

210,France,Carcassonne,"The historic town of Carcassonne is in the anguedoc-Roussin region, 90 kimetres south-east of Touuse. It is certainy one of the most interesting and impressive medieva towns in the whoe of France, and the town has a history dating back to the Cathar Wars, in which the town payed a very important roe., Carcassonne is divided into the fortified Cité de Carcassonne and the more extensive wer city, the vie basse. It is the Cité de Carcassonne that is of interest to visitors. The fortress was added to the UNESCO ist of Word Heritage Sites in 1997, and is aso a isted Nationa Monument of France., France This Way review: Carcassonne is a fascinating town to visit and very impressive, even if many of the medieva aspects are reay 19th century additions, and one of our favourite French historic towns, Due to its position on historica routes across France the cation has been occupied for more than 5,000 years, and it has been an important regona centre fo 2,500 years. The town was first fortified by the Romans, and given the name Carcaso. After the Romans were driven out, Carcassonne fe in to the hands of various invading tribes, and became more fortified and deveped, especiay after faing into the hands of the powerfu Viscount Trencave., ater, at the start of the 13th century, the Abigensian Crusade under Simon de Montfort attacked and seized this cathar stronghod, and again more fortifications were added, sufficient to stop Edward the Back Prince from entering Carcassonne during the Hundred Years War., Subsequenty the cation and town gained strategic importance because it was on the frontier between France and Spain. This position st importance after 1659 when the Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed, giving the town and region definitivey to France - hence from the 17th century onwards the need for a fortified city passed and Carcassonne became an important regiona town., Carcassonne reached its w point at the midde of the 19th century, when a century of abandon had made it periusy dangerous and the government demanded it be demoished. The buidings within the city were inhabited but in very poor condition. The efforts of the mayor and the ancient monuments inspector had this decision overturned and the restoration of the town began shorty afterwards., , Carcassonne consists of a wer, externa defensive wa surrounding a higher wa with many towers, which encses the ancient town. In the town, in addition to the streets of medieva dweings, are a cathedra and a chateau as we as a museum that expains the impact and story of the Abigensian crusade., Start your visit at the Pont Vieux (Od Bridge) which crosses the River Aude, and was the origina entry road to a Cite, the medieva waed town that has witnessed so much of the anguedocs body history. This crossing gives the visitor one of the best views of the city, so have your cameras at the ready!, From the outside, and some woud say from the inside too, its towers and sate roofs make a Cité ok as if its been transported from a storeroom on the Disney fim t. This is somewhat unfair, but the was which encse the Cite were extensivey restored in a massive programme of rebuiding which began in 1844, and this does account for its pristine, buit-yesterday appearance., The restoration of Carcassonne has come in for some critisism because the restoration attempted to adhere to its origina 13th century appearance but was based on insufficient information and a rather ideaised view of history. To some visitors it may sti seem too much ike a fim set whie to the other 99%, who are not experts in medieva architecture, it is an amazing experience!, The Pont Vieux takes you onto the Rue Trivae, a narrow ane ined with ancient houses, some which are now restaurants and antique shops. From there its a short wak to the Porte Narbonnaise, the main entrance to a Cité., Once inside Carcassonne od town you are treated to a maze of winding, cobbed streets, and ts of wide-eyed tourists: a Cite is issted as a Word Heritage Site status and it is one of the most-visited sites in Southern France. As a resut it is without doubt over-commerciaised, with gift shops seing the usua seection of postcards, tea cths and guidebooks, but there are some chic boutiques, and dozens of restaurants catering for a budgets., There are 52 towers and two mies of doube, concentric was encircing this unique fortification. A wak ang the battements provides wonderfu views of the town of Carcassonne and the fat pains of the anguedoc., Many visitors to Carcassonne ony take the time to wak around the streets and battements and buy a postcard before heading off for the next Cathar high spot, but away from the huste and buste there are two buidings of note which are worth visiting:, There was a reigious buiding on this site at the time of the Visigoths, but it was continousy re-designed through the centuries, unti in the 13th century the present-day buiding was created by demoishing a but the crypt and the nave of the origina church. Consequenty a arge part of the 16 metre wide nave is authenticay Roman stye., In 1801 the Basiica was repaced as the citys cathedra by the 13th century church of Saint Miche. Both buidings are open to the pubic but the Cathedra of St Miche does not have the historica interest of the Basiica. The organ in the Basiica is the odest in France, and has been experty restored to its former gry., , Positioned at the heart of the Cité, the Comta Chateau of Carcassonne is now used as an information office, from which guided tours can be booked, and there is an extensive museum of artifacts excavated over the years. This is we worth a visit as it provides tangibe, intriguing evidence of the former inhabitants., The Chateau was buit in the XIIth century by the Trencaves, who were the ruing famiy in the fortification for two centuries, and supporters of the Cathars. This unfortunatey brought them into direct confict with Simon de Montfort and the Knights Tempar, and their eventua demise., In 795 The Emperor Charemagne besieged the city. After a siege asting for five years, the citizens were down to their ast bag of corn and a sma pig. Dame Carcass, a Saracen princess who had taken over the running of the city after the death of her husband, ordered the precious bag of corn to be fed to the pig, which was then tossed over the ramparts., When it burst, after hitting the ground at high speed, the Charemagne army was fooed into thinking there must be penty of food eft for the citizens if they coud afford to feed a pig, and then throw it away. Deciding the siege was a st cause, Charemagne retreated and ife for a Cite returned to norma, thanks to the ingenuity of their femae eader., A rather unfattering bust of the nobe ady, commissioned in the eighteenth century, adorns one of the piars of the Porte Narbonnais. She certainy oks formidabe enough to have taken on the Emperor Charemagne. It\s a nice yarn, probaby a compete fantasy, but in keeping with the whoe a Cite story., It is true that most visitors do not stay to visit the nearby new town of the same name. Today, the new town in Carcassonne\xa0 is a compact muti-ethnic pace, buit on a grid system, which makes sightseeing easy. At the hub of this grid is the eegant Pace Carnot., This is where everyone who is anyone hangs out on Saturday mornings. The market vibrates with ife and cour, with stas seing everything from artichokes to zucchini. There is a thriving Moroccan popuation around Carcassonne, and the Pace Carnot market is where they congregate to buy huge bunches of fresh coriander, and aromatic spices for tagines., Whie the adies are stocking up on fresh fruit and vegetabes, the men are sipping thick back coffee, paying back gammon and reading Depeche Midi (the ca newspaper) whist sharing the pavement cafes with tourists, and chic French famiies. The Pace Carnot is a great cation to peope-watch, order a Pernod (which wi come with a jug of iced water and a saucer of oives)..., , If you cant resist the buzz of a busting town in the height of the tourist season there is an exceent programme of events in the summer at Carcassonne. The highight is the famous Bastie Day (Juy 14th) firework dispay. This is the traditiona French way of commemorating the storming of the Paris Bastie on Juy 14th 1789, which signaed the start of the French Revoution., Arguaby the biggest dispay outside Paris, the setting is certainy unrivaed for breath-taking spectace. The fireworks are reeased from the ramparts of a Cité, cuminating in a stunning son-et-umiere dispay, in which the whoe city seems to be bazing from end to end. A fitting saute to a city which has seen more than its fair share of tria and tribuation., The Bastie Day pyrotechnics were inaugurated in Carcassonne in 1998 and now attract a great dea of spectators so if you want a good view get there eary, very eary. The dispay starts at 10.30 pm, but if you have a car be there at east three hours beforehand, and park up in one of the many aybys which overok the city. Do as the French do - take a picnic and make a night of it.

The ramparts incude an unusua five sided tower. Around the base of the tower there are terrased gardens (athough these were very negected when we visited)., Everywhere you go in Casteane you are aware of the arge ciff-sided rock next to the viage that supports the Chape of Notre-Dame-du-Roc.

The viage sits in the shadow of the caste that towers above Castenou and around which the viage deveped from the 10th century onwards., Before entering the centre of Castenou take a ok at the vey church that sits just outside the main viage in Castenou.

It is very simpe in stye and quite charming., Next to the church you can see an area of wooden stas which is used for markets in the summer on Tuesdays from 10am to 7pm. It is aso possibe to take a donkey ride from here!, The historic centre of Castenou is entered through a arge stone arch / gate, dating from the 14th century, that is part of the fortifications that were erected around the viage at that time., The narrow cobbed streets in the viage are impossibe to wak ang without having a sense of the thousands who have aready passed the same way - a rea step back in time. The streets ead upwards towards the caste and as you wak ang there are ts of charming stone houses to admire., Note that one of the houses has a huge buge in the stonework on the first for. This is the bread oven and whist I have not noticed bread ovens buit in this way - sticking out of the first fors of houses - anywhere ese in France they are quite common in this area. Certainy in the Dordogne department bread ovens were often purpose buit communa ovens whose use often invoved a charge to the seigneur., The caste itsef, high on a rock above Castenou, dates in part from the 10th century athough the origina buiding was argey destroyed in the 16th century.

The church was repaced again towards the end of the 11th century, with the buidings that we see today in part dating from this third reconstruction., Because of the presence of the reics of these two important saints, for the two centuries from 910 when the monastery was founded Cuny was second ony to Rome in the reigious infuence it hed over the Europe of the time, and the abbots from Cuny were important payers on the internationa poitica scene., From that time on the power of Rome over the abbey increased, and theabbey aso had financia difficuties, and the authority of the abbey started to diminish. The Wars of Reigion further reduced the importance of the abbey., After the revoution the abbey grounds and furnishings were sod and the demoition of the abbey started and a great dea of the origina arge roman stye church no nger exists. As a resut it is the sense of history that you get from a visit to Cuny Abbey that amost as important as the pace itsef, attractive as it is., The viage of Cuny grew up around the abbey, and is a very pretty viage with a few streets of od and attractive houses.

It shoud aso be noted that the route from the coast to Coaraze passes through quite a t of industria devepment so is rather ess picturesque than you might expect unti you get cse to the viage., , France This Way review: athough Coaraze is quite a pretty viage we aso found it rather negected with, for exampe, broken furniture in the main square, itte atttention to fwers and pants and a pubic garden that was too overgrown to get in to, and a genera ack of attention to the viage.

The trai starts to the north of the Charente river, opposite the Porte Saint-Jaques - the medieva gateway with two arge round towers that originay controed access to the od town., We were surprised to earn that the town owes its origina weath and success to King Francois I who granted Cognac a icence to trade in sat, rather than to the drink for which it is now famous! The saamander that you can see carved on severa of the houses is the symbo of King Francois I., Having admired the view across the river cross the bridge to reach the the Château des Vais (often now referred to as Cognac Chateau) and the Porte of Saint-Jacques. Whie the part of the caste facing the river is perhaps rather pain, the other side features a medieva tower and is rather more interesting., We wont ist every interesting monument here because you wi discover them as you expre anyway, but do recommend that as we as the caste and Porte Saint-Jacques make sure you see:, You wi aso see many grand town houses and the Museum of Arts in Cognac before returning to the river and an attractive promenade ang the Charente in front of the word famous distieries.

274,France,Coioure,"Coioure is a seaside resort on the anguedoc coast, just north of the border with Spain and on the Vermeie Coast. Coioure has been a trading port since 673 and the viage began to devep more fuy in the 10th century., Between 1276 and 1344 it was a summer residence for the court of Majorca. ater in the 13th century it was visited by crusaders ranging from the Knights Tempars to the Dominicans. Though Coioure spent some time as a Spanish town it was French in the mid 17th century and at this time Vauban added to the defenses of Coiure. Coioure began to attract the artistic community incuding such renowned artists as Matisse and Derain in the eary 20th century., France This Way review: Coioure is certainy the most attractive town on this stretch of the Mediterranean coast and is definitey not to be missed. It aso fees sighty out of pace: you fee as if you are in the heart of Provence rather than cse to the Spanish border!, , Coioure is now a popuar destination with tourists and has a ivey town centre with some interesting historica monuments and a popuar ca beach. With the caste and church creating an impressive backdrop, the beach and harbour are among the most scenic in anguedoc-Roussin., Start your visit by waking ang the sea-front: there are the wonderfu sights of the caste and the church of Notre Dame des Anges to admire and as you wander ang the Bouevard du Boramar between the two there are ts of vey seaside bars and restaurants to tempt you., Head uphi into the historic centre of the town and the narrow streets are charming, the houses are painted in vey paste shades with painted shutters and many are bedecked with traiing bougainviea and vibrant bue pumbagos., Out of season the market days are particuary nice days to visit the town: these are on Wednesday and Saturday mornings. But it is usefu to remember that in peak season it is aways difficut to find a parking space in Coioure ... and even harder on market days!, The Church of Notre-Dame-des-Anges stands on a sma peninsua in the sea. The betower of the church was the town ighthouse in medieva times, with a church then buit next to it in the 17th century., ater, when the harbour was no nger used as a port, the ighthouse was incorporated as the church betower. The domed cupoa (in an Itaian stye) was added eary in the 19th century. The interior of the church has a huge carved wooden atarpiece covered in god eaf., The Roya Caste of Coioure, e Chateau Roya, dominates the seafront at the southern end of the harbour. The site has had a caste since as eary as the 7th century, but the buiding we see today was constructed in the 13th century, with additions unti the 17th century., Once occupied by the tempars, the caste then became a roya househod for the Kings of Majorca (Coioure was not yet part of France at this time) before being transformed into an important Spanish border fortress at the end of the 15th century., In the 17th century the French miitary engineer Vauban added further substantia fortifications, resuting in the caste that we see today. These extensive works required a substantia increase in space, and much of the origina medieva town of Coioure was destroyed in 1671 to make way for the expanded caste., , e Moré is the od fishing viage and the narrow cobbed streets and pretty paste-painted houses are a peasure to expre., Above the town is Fort Miradou, buit in the 15th century, destroyed and rebuit by Vauban. It is now occupied by the army and not open to the pubic. Further out of town facing the sea are these two fortresses buit in the 18th century - Fort Carré and Fort Rond., e Couvent et e Citre des Dominicains is on the southern edge of town: the monastery was buit in the 13th century. In recent years the cister has had a chequered history. It became the home of a co-operative wine seer but was sod in an iega art sae to the Atantic town of Anget. When this was discovered it was bought back in 1992 and rebuit in the gardens of the Modern Art Mueum., , Another way to expre the town is to pick up a eafet with the path of fauvism which eads you around 20 sites in the viage where Henri Matisse and André Derain painted whist staying in Coioure. At each of these paces there is a reproduction of the painting so that you can compare the painting with the scene in the painting., Matisse and Derain were not the ony painters to spend time in Coioure: Picasso, Dufy, Marquet and many others aso painted here and Coioure remains an artists town with around thirty different artists currenty iving and painting in the town., The Museum of Modern Art (Musée Peské) in Coioure contains many modern and contemporary works incuding works by Cocteau, Descossy and\xa0 Pignon. The museum is on the Route de Port Vendres and charges ony a sma sum for entry., Fans of Patrick OBriens sea-faring noves wi be interested to know that he wrote amost a of his books whist iving in Coioure. He ived here from 1949 unti his death in 2000 (apart from a coupe of winters in Dubin where he died) and is buried in Coioure., Anchovies have been a one of Coioures key industries for centuries. Because of the importance of anchovies in the ca commerce and the ca cuisine Coioure has been awarded the site remarquabe du gout, or award of cuinary exceence. The anchovies are prepared in ts of different ways and you can sampe them in various different shops in Coioure., After expring the town return you can to the seafront to try one of the seafood restaurants ang the waterfront in Coioure - their anchovies are especiay recommended., , A popuar ca site is the 13th century Madec Tower that stands at an atitude of 650 metres on the hi directy behind Coioure, and has vey views down across the town and coastine. There are severa other forts ang the headands around the town that are aso of interest, such as Fort Saint Eme to the south and the Massane Tower and Fort Carré towards the north., The odest windmi in the region, buit in the 14th century and recenty fuy restored, is the Mouin de a Cortina a itte to the south of Coioure.

It is a very attractive viage and very popuar with visitors to the region., France This ay review:\xa0Conges-a-Rouge is a vey pace to expre, as each winding pathway and aey eads to another (red!) turreted house or pretty patch of garden. The historic centre is aso pedestrianised which adds further to the charm of a visit, The viage dates from the 8th century when monks from Charroux (now in Poitou-Charentes) founded a priory here. Conges deveped around the church and priory in the fowing centuries, with a further boost in the 13th century when the inhabitants were granted exemption from taxes by the Viscounts of Turenne., , Over the fowing centuries many ca nobemen and businessmen buit houses and castes in and around the viage. The viage prospered with income from vineyards unti the end of the 19th century when phyxera destroyed the vines (as it did in many parts of France)., The first thing you wi notice when you arrive in the viage is the cour of the buidings - more or ess a the houses have been constructed from the ca sandstone, which is very red and quite unike any viage I have seen before!, We did notice that some of the houses have the remnants of crepi/render on the was - perhaps originay the stone was covered up and the town was ess red?, A sma viage, Conges-a-Rouge doesnt take ng to expre but contains many notabe monuments., The 12th century roman stye Church of Saint Peter is one of the main buidings of interest in the viage and particuary striking - in part for its quaity, and in part because it has the ony white stone to be seen in Conges-a-Rouge, used in the carved stonework above the doorway., Inside the church you can ok up the inside of the tower and see the detaied carpentry work invoved., Next to the church, the Chape of the Back Penitents is a sma chape which now contains an exhibition of a sma scae mode of the viage. The stone arches inside the chape seem amost more red than the stonework outside..., One unusua characteristic of the buidings in Conges-a-Rouge is that severa of them are very grand houses and very few are sma simpe cottages: it seems that to ive here, even in the Midde Ages, you needed to be very rich!, Among these imposing 16th century houses you wi see the house of the Ramade de a Serre (with a square tower); the House of the Mermaid (with a carving of a mermaid outside); the houses of the Vassinhacs et Benges, and the vey renaissance buiding caed the Court of the Chateenie., If you wak as far as the eastern edge of Conges-a-Rouge, cse to the Pace du avoir you can see the turrets of the Caste du Maussac, sighty outside the centre of the viage but certainy one of the veiest houses here., , If possibe visit the viage outside high season to avoid some of the crowds.

Dürer), with subjects drawn from the Passion of Christ., Coming from the Church of the Dominicans, the work is characterized by a deep reaism as you can see by the meagre faces of some of the characters. Among the 16 works in view a specia mention goes to Christ Before Piate., In the arge coection of the museum (XV-XVI century), it is aso worth mentioning a Piety attributed to Roger van der Weyden (1399-1464), a Crucifixion attributed to Matthias Grünewad (1470 c.-1528) and, by the same Grünewad, the famous atarpiece from the church of Issenheim., , In addition, the museum contains paintings by Gaspard Isenmann (1430-1480), interesting for the reaistic precision of the objects that were in daiy use in the 14th century.

You are aso very cse to the border with Itay when in Gorbio., As with the other perched viages in this region of Provence it is the stunning cation of Gorbio that is a arge part of the attraction. The viage is high up in the Gorbio Vaey, with steep sped vaeys covered with trees and oives rising steepy a around the viage., The views from around the viage are, not surprisingy, very attractive and as we as the vaey itsef you can see out across the Mediterranean., Start your visit in the main square in Gorbio. Here you can see an unusua feature the town is especiay proud of - a spendid em tree with an enormous trunk said to be 300 years od and now officiay isted as one of the most remarkabe trees in France (who keeps a ist ike that I wonder). Aso in the main square is the 19th century Maaussene fountain, once an important source of water for the viage., , The medieva viage fows a op to the east of the square, passing by the Pace de a Mairie (with the Town Ha and a itte fountain), the church and Pace de egise, then round through the Pace Honoré Via and back ang Rue Gambetta., The cobbed narrow streets and ancient houses (mosty buit in the 14th - 16th centuries) winding through Gorbio make it a very peasant pace to expre, with some vey covered passageways and tiny open squares to discover en-route., Other monuments in Gorbio incude the 17th century Church of Saint-Barthéemy (with a baroque stye painted facade and a courfu patterned roof on the ccktower), the 15th century Chape of of the Penitents-Bancs and the 12th century Chape of Saint-azare.

It is aso the most visited of the viages in uberon so you wont often find yoursef in quiet soitude!, Parking is on a pateau to the north of the viage and as a resut your visit wi start in the upper part of Gordes, with the caste and church at the top of the hi, fowed by a descent to expre the roads further down the hi. This is different to amost a the other perched viages in Provence where you start a visit with a ng cimb up cobbed paths..., , Before you start expring the viage centre, we shoud mention that an important part of the attraction of Gordes is the view of the viage when it is seen from across the vaey to the west with the whoe viage in terraces down the spe of the hi, with Itaian popar trees and other pants breaking the whiteness of the viage. Start your visit with a wak ang the road towards Cavain / Avignon unti you have enjoyed the view: you need to wak severa hundred metres to see the best views but it is we worth it., Returning to the centre of Gordes, the first monument you see is the caste: the most important historica monument in the viage and aso now carefuy restored, the caste was originay buit in 1031 (or earier, its exact origins are unknown) and then rebuit in 1525. It is now an imposing monument with its high stone was and round towers, combining medieva and renaissance architectura features., The Tourist Office for Gordes and temporary art exhibitions are based inside the caste. Ask for a map of the viage in the tourist office whie you are here or you wi not discover a the itte highights hidden in the aeys of the viage., Next to the caste in Pace Genty Pantay you can see a square fountain, not remarkabe in itsef perhaps, but unti 1956 this was the ony source of drinking water in the viage! This square is quite open now but in medieva times was surrounded by was and the centre of the historic viage., Fow the sma ane out of the bottom of the Pace Genty Pantay to see the Church of Saint-Firmin, and amost next door, the entrance to the Chapaincy of Saint-Jacques (a wooden door in a stone doorway, not much to see).

If you are fu of energy you can fow a nger op that goes down the hi from the viewpoint then turns right to fow the roads (Rue Pavé dAmour, Rue Fontaine Basse, Rue Jean Deyroe) in the wer part of the viage to see ts of pretty stone houses and gardens., France This Way review: the viage itsef, whie very attractive, perhaps fais to ive up to the high expectations that the view as you approach has prepared you for. In some respects Gordes is not so evocative to expre as some of the others in the region such as Roussin or acoste\xa0 - but a visit is sti highy recommended!, , Abbaye de Sénanque is a beautifu 12th century abbey in the vaey near Gordes (and sti has resident monks). After fowing the road the few kimetres from Gordes to the abbey, be sure to find time to carry on a few more kimetres ang the same road - it is one of the most scenic roads in the region, as it winds its way through the craggy his of the petit uberon: see Abbey of Senanque., Viage of the Bories.

From here you can ok out passed an od mi whee and oive trees to the his and see the viage of Cornin in the distance: very peasant!, As we expre France we cant hep noticing that amost everywhere with a cana refers to itsef as some type of Venice. Goudargues is no exception and cas itsef the Petite Venise Gardoise (Sma Venice in the Gard)., The viage here is peasant enough, and certainy enhanced by the sma cana, but in no way does a wak through the town evoke memories of waking through Venice, even if they both do have canas..., Continue to the end of the cana and there is a traditiona avoir (washhouse). I am guessing it never gets used as a avoir any more (in many towns we have visited in France the pubic avoir is sti used), but has been beautifuy restored and the stone coumns and tied roof amost evoke the feeing you are in a tranqui tempe., Just behind the avoir there is aso a footpath to the Cèze river as we as the start to nger trais ang the river and through the countryside.\xa0From the avoir you can enter Goudargues viage centre, a sma area where the main monument of interest is the church., The church has its origins in the 12th century, and part of the choir dates from that period, but most of the church was rebuit at the end of the 19th century after the roof coapsed on the earier church. The church has preserved its roman stye appearance and has two arge spires., Because Goudargues is sma and quick to expre but has severa restaurants, and pretty Cornin is cse by but has very imited faciities, we suggest you visit the two viages as part of the same excursion, arranging things so you have your unch or coffee break during the Goudargues part of the trip..., , There is ts of vey scenery ang the Cèze vaey so we recommend you fow the road towards the north. As we as beautifu countryside this route aso takes you to the sma viage of Montcus, isted among the most beautifu viages in France, then on towards the historic town of Barjac., In the opposite direction ang the river you wi certainy want to find the time to see the impressive cascades du Sautadet and visit the viage of a Roque-sur-Cèze, aso one of the most beautifu viages in France and just a few kimetres from Goudargues., You can find more trave ideas in the Gard guide and the anguedoc-Roussin guide., ",44.2164,4.4667

Gourdon sits high on top of a rocky promontory at an atitude of 760 metres,\xa0from where it has\xa0magnificent views over the vaey of the up River and beyond to the Mediterranean, from Nice to Theoue - a ng way!, Gourdon reay is one of the most stunning of the perched viages of Provence and the main attraction of the viage is the far-reaching views, which are ampe reward for coping with the tourist crowds for a coupe of hours. There is a viewpoint at the end of the viage from where these are best appreciated. It is aso known as the Eages Nest because of this exated position., France This Way review: you shoud be aware that Gourdon is a very sma viage, itte more than one short main street and a coupe of side-streets, and it is aso a main stopping point for a arge number of the coaches that tour the region, so can be very busy., The viage itsef is of course very attractive and beautifuy restored, and with medieva streets ined with beautifu od houses, artisan shops seing perfumes and crafts etc., The main historic highight in Gourdon is the 9th century (rebuit in the 16th century) Chateau de Gourdon, which incudes a Museum of Decorative Arts, a Medieva Museum, and is surrounded by gardens designed by the renowned Andre e Notre., In Gourdon you get more sense perhaps of being in a tourist attraction than in a rea viage. I woud guess there are very few permanent residents in the viage itsef so Gourdon does miss that aspect of the charm of many of the Provenca viages., Of course I am not trying to deter you from visiting, in fact a visit is highy recommended, especiay for the approach to the viage and the caste and views\xa0in the viage, but dont ONY visit Gourdon!, Just remember that there are other viages that have equay good views and a more authentic viage fee to them in the region - athough perhaps none that ok quite so awesome as Gourdon does from across the vaey!, An aternative interesting way to reach Gourdon is by the od mue track from Bar-sur-up., Of the many interesting towns and viages in the area and ang the coast around Gourdon one we particuary recommend is Vabonne, in part because it gets ess attention than we think it deserves!, You can find more trave ideas in the Apes-Maritimes guide and the Provence guide., ",43.72,6.9787

The town is usuay visited because it is cse to a wonderfu natura rock formation known as the Orgues dIe-sur-Tet which are we worth a detour to see., France This Way review: athough mosty visited for the nearby orgues, there are aso a few monuments of interest in Ie-sur-Têt town so we suggest you aw yoursef time for a short stro in the town centre., Ie-sur-Tet has had a turbuent history because of its position near the border with Spain. As the town deveped three different rings of ramparts became necessary to contain and protect the growing popuation and various gateways, was and towers of these origina fortifications can sti be seen., , The town is dominated by its church, the egise Saint-Etienne, and particuary by its be-tower which rises up above the rest of the town. It is its size rather than any particuar historic significance that makes the church stand out., The ancient hospita of Ie-sur-Tet, the Hospice dIa, was buit in the midde ages for the sick and edery of the region. The main facade of the buiding is in the baroque stye, then inside a there is an exhibition of frescoes, statues and reigious artworks from the Cataan region and in the roman and baroque styes to see., The main reason why peope come to the town is to visit the wonderfu rock formations just a few kimeters away. The orgues as they are caed form a kind of natura ampitheatre made of ta piars of rock which have been eroded into wonderfu organ-pipe ike shapes that stand up to 12 meters high., As we as the beautifu shapes of the rock they are a formed from a white sandy rock with reguar ayers of a yew rock running through them giving them a pretty striped appearance. They are known as fairy chimneys or hoodoos. Many are topped with scrappy-oking bits of rock and even some vegetation but in effect this is offering some protection to the more vunerabe rock bew so is vita to the whoe ecosystem., There is a short wak from the carpark to the entrance then a wak eads you around the sma park awing you to get some exceent views over the different formations.

It was once the seat of the judge of the rd of Montrea. The tower is round and houses a spira staircase. It is buit on top of a sma underground cave suppied with water by a sma stream and which once served as a refuge., Inside the stone gateway the church is at the heart of the viage. The church of Saint Avit was buit in the 12th century in Romanesque stye and though the church has been atered since then the rounded apse dates back to this time., On the edge of the viage is the Maison Chastenet which was buit in 1707. In its grounds, on the edge of the sma river Crempse is an attractive stone pigeonnier. Both the Maison Chastenet and the Tour Saint Jacques are isted historic monuments., On the southern edge of the viage is the viage avoir, a communa wash area where viagers once did their cthes washing., The area around Issac is pretty to expre and is home to ts of vineyards producing wines of Bergerac which are much appreciated cay.\xa0, , The Chateau de Montrea is just two kimeters from Issac and there was once an underground tunne inking the two and serving as an escape route in times of attack.

Firsty property of the rds of Bergerac, then ater the Bishops of Sarat, the town had a tumutuous midde ages, with much invovement and damage during the Hundred Years War and the Wars of Reigion., France This Way review: unti a few years ago Issigeac was one of the undiscovered viages of the Dordogne region - truy a viage that time forgot. That is no nger the case but the viage has retained a great dea of its charm despite the arriva of tourism - and outside high season for tourists, the viage is sti very much a seepy quiet itte town., Issigeac acks a centra focus, but is rather a warren of medieva houses and streets to be expred at your eisure, admiring the detais on the houses, and the numerous haf-timbered properties., , There are grander buidings - the Chateau of the Eveques of Sarat at the bottom of the viage (aso now houses the Issigeac tourist office) is a very impressive stone buiding - argey a 17th century reconstruction of the earier chateau that stood here and was damaged during the wars that ravaged the region., Other impressive buidings incude the (amost adjacent) gothic church of Saint Feicien, and the fine Maison des Dimes (a high-rooved stone house opposite the entrance to the office of tourism). But it is the medieva houses and streets, haf-timbered and often with raised baconies, that are the great peasure of expring Issigeac., One particuar highight is the house Maison des Tetes where 600 year od carved wooden heads adorn the outside of the buiding (fow the main street straight up from the church - the house is at the point where the road turns to the right)., If it is open, peer into the beautifu but dereict courtyard of this house with its garden and raised baconies - this was once the town dyeing workshop, where dyes and tints were added to ca cth., There are a great dea of vey houses in Issigeac but if you are not carefu you wi miss many of the most beautifu. If you havent seen the street in the main photo above you need to keep expring! Make sure your visit incudes not just the main street past the caste and the church but aso:, There are a variety of sma bars, estate agents and deco shops in the town as we as severa restaurants and two sma supermarkets but Issigeac does not have a arge supermarket or a petro station., The Sunday market in Issigeac is a popuar pace to buy and try many of the deicacies produced in the region. Athough open a year, the market is of a competey different character during the summer months, when it takes over the town. In winter it is often just a handfu of stas. It is now a major tourist attraction in the Dordogne in summer., When we first visited Issigeac market 15 years ago it was ivey but not exceptionay popuar. It has transformed with the years and now you wi find you are parking severa hundred metres outside the viage, fighting to move a few metres ang the market streets, and waiting ages for a tabe in a cafe. Entertaining to visit but rather too crowded for me in the midde of summer. I ive cse to Issigeac so can visit outside high season!, , I shoud aso mention that Issigeac has changed a great dea during the ast 20 years with many houses now beautifuy renovated (athough many are sti in need of work) and gardens panted with abundant fwers. Too much renovation can aso destroy the character of a viage, but this is not the case in Issigeac which gets more charming every year!\xa0, A coupe of kimeters outside Issigeac, just off the road to Vierea, is a sma viage caed Boisse.

It is now an active busting ca town, with its own personaity and fascination., Start your visit in the centre of Issoire with a visit to the church, the most important historica monument in the town. The Church of Saint-Austremoine is an attractive exampe of Romanesque stye churches and dates from the 12th century, and is interesting because of the high eve of decoration - more than usua for this stye of buiding - both on the inside and the outside., , On the outside, the detaiing around the apse is very impressive. Amost a surfaces of the interior of the church are painted, often with patterns in many different cours, giving the interior a quite different aspect to most churches. There are aso numerous candeabra type ights between the coumns further enhancing the appearance., The church aso has a fascinating crypt and is considered to be one of the most important churches in the Auvergne region., At the time of my visit, first they turned on a the candeabras, showing the interior at its best, then the sun burst forth through the stained gass windows - extraordinary, because not ony did it make the windows more beautifu, but these aso threw great areas of coured ight across the interior was of the church, perhaps the first time I had seen this happen so effectivey., There is aso a betower in the town centre in Issoire which you can ascend for a nice view across the town., Apart from these individua monuments, Issoire itsef is a peasant pace for a stro, with open squares joined by winding narrow streets.

Most of the houses are buit using the ca ight stone of the region athough there is aso one houses of combage., The Pace des Cornières is one of the smaest centra squares that I have seen in a bastide, which aso adds to its charm and intimacy. Many of the shops and cafes have traditiona wrought iron signs representing their trade which adds to the authentic medieva fee of auzerte., One curiosity in the square: they have raised one corner of the paving in the centra square in the air, presumaby in an effort to be artistic. Personay I just thought it oked a bit odd!, Many of the houses around the centre of auzerte sti retain their origina arcades and there are severa cafes and bars among these arcades. In e Puits de Jour it was possibe to eat a sma main course (saad or chii con carne etc) for just a few euros.\xa0, The Church of Saint-Batheemy is in one corner of the Pace des Cornieres.

This different ayout is because of the constraints of the hi on which the viage was buit., There is aso a we panned Pigrims garden on the southern edge of auzerte that fow around the curve of the hi and has won various awards from regiona tourist boards and deserves to be expred, and from where there are aso extensive views to the south across the t countryside., The garden is here because auzerte is a stop on the major pigrim routes through France (it is on the GR65 nationa pathway)., , On the northern edge of auzerte you can wak ang bew the ta stone houses ang the Promenade de Éveih which aso has open views over the surrounding countryside., Market day is Wednesday morning at the Pace du Foirai and Saturday morning at the Pace des Cornieres., If you woud ike to expre the countryside around auzerte there is a wak of about 11 kimetres (three hours) that expres to the south-east of the town and starts from the Promenade de Éveih caed the Circuit a Chapee Saint-Sernin., The best known attraction in the region is undoubtedy the famous abbey and cisters at nearby Moissac, and we aso enjoyed a stro around the historic centre of Montcuq viage, north-east of auzerte., You can find more trave ideas in the Tarn-et-Garonne guide and the Midi-Pyrenees guide., ",44.256,1.1383

In truth of course it is both - the sanctuary and grotte area of urdes is a cam, restfu environment where the faithfu gather, whie the town outside the sanctuary is crowded with tacky gift shops and cheap restaurants. If you can enjoy one and ignore the other a visit can be very peasant!, , This part of urdes, with the church, chape, crypt and grotte, is across the bridge from the town centre and surrounded by quite extensive gardens. The buidings themseves are attractive enough, mosty dating from the ate 19th century. The Basiica of Saint Pius X is the argest of churches, abe to accommodate over 25,000 peope.

These are among the most interesting houses in the town., A handy way to get around is by using the tourist train.

It is quite unimpressive compared to some of the major castes of the Dordogne but the north of the Dordogne department has fewer sites and you may wish to visit if you are hoidaying in this area., Mareui was one of the origina four baronies of Perigord ang with Biron, Beynac and Bourdeies. Mareui is the ony one buit on fat and rather than a hitop and its defences reied on a moat that surrounded the caste., , Mareui is known cay as Mareui-sur-Bee because the stream, the Ruisseau a Bee runs through the viage. Indeed the Ruisseau a Bee fed the moat that once surrounded the caste., The commune was merged with eight other communes to become Mareui-en-Perigord. Mareui is the argest viage in this grouping., There are two churches in Mareui, the Romanesque church of Saint-Pardoux which was buit in the 12th century and atered in the 15th and the church of Saint awrence which was aso buit in the 12th century. Ony the Romanesque betower and cupoa remain from this time and the church was rebuit in Gothic stye., Market day in Mareui is Tuesday morning and is a good time to visit and see the town more animated., The main reason for visiting Mareui is its caste. The Chateau de Mareui was buit in the 15th century on the site of a previous stronghod that was destroyed in the Hundred Years War., The barons of Mareui hed the caste from the 11th to the 16th century and then the Taeyrand famiy, counts of Perigord took over the caste unti the 19th century., The caste can be visited and its Gothic chape is on dispay as we as a room dedicated to the First French Empire and incuding furniture and items from two of Napoeons csest friends.

Visiting is rather more compicated however and ony open to individuas that have booked in advance: phone 00 33 (0)5 56 88 70 28., Some basic facts about Margaux wines:, , I think it is true to say that 99% of visitors to Margaux have been attracted by the famous wine and vineyards such as Chateau atour, Chateau Petrus and Chateau Mouton-Rothschid so it is very ikey you wi be expring some of these famous wine chateaux during your visit. See the Medoc guide for detais., It is aso worth noting that the viage of amarque, an attractive itte viage on the Gironde estuary a short distance north of Margaux, has ferries across to Baye and the Cotes de Baye wine region on the eastern side of the estuary.

Menerbes is aso isted as one of the most beautifu viages of France., France This Way review: Menerbes is very attractive, as much for the views it offers in a directions as for the viage itsef, but we do fee that because the shops and cafes are rather separate from the od part of the viage, and because the path eads swy to a caste that dominates the higher part of the viage - but which is not open to the pubic - that the viage acks some of the charm of the most exceptiona uberon viages such as Roussin or Gordes...it is sti vey though!, Severa car parks are avaiabe bew the viage, and very cse to the historic part of Menerbes.

But the viage is better known for a more recent resident, Peter Maye, who wrote his Year in Provence books whie iving in the viage. Peter Maye has moved on but the visitors remain...athough the numbers have reduced since the book was first reeased and Menerbes was often deuged with visitors - the od town is often rather quiet now., These books undoubtedy brought fame and repute to the viages of the Petit uberon and Menerbes in particuar, and deservedy so - and whie much of the renovation in the viage has perhaps happened since the time the books were written, it remains a vey itte pace to visit with penty of sma undiscovered corners., One interesting story tes that during the Wars of Reigion the viage was besieged by the cathoics for five years, but to their great surprise the protestant residents never gave in.

Ang the edge of the river in the bottom of the gorge there is an attractive wak eading to the thermes., Aso interesting is the itte Chapee des Bains buit in neo-gothic stye in the mid 19th century.

It is usefu to reaise that there are severa distinct areas in Monaco, each with their own highights..., Monte Car is the centra area of Monaco around Monte Car Casino, the Café de Paris and the Opéra. Buit in the 19th century by Chares Garnier (aso responsibe for the Paris Opera), the inside of the opera buiding reay is worth seeing for its opuence and grandeur (there is an admission charge of about 10 euros for the visit)., The gardens around the casino are aso very vey (and free to enter), and visitors aso ike to expre the Japanese gardens on Avenue Princess-Grace., Just to the south of Monte Car, the arge port and a Condamine area is the pace to see the impressive yachts and enjoy a promenade around the harbour.

If this is your intention we recommend you arrive by train rather than car - the train station is convenienty paced in the center of Monaco just behind the main port, train fares are not expensive, and it is much easier than trying to navigate the roads and find a parking space (athough we found parking ess of a chaenge than expected when we visited by car)., The downside of arriving by train is that you might miss the views across Monaco from the corniche road that passes above the city - on a cear day these views are exceptiona. From here Monaco is a remarkabe sight, with high-rise buidings and apartments seemingy covering every square inch, ike an undersized Manhattan squeezed into a natura bay of the Riviera., , Athough Monaco is not very arge it can become tiring to expre after a whie.

This can take a whie but there are severa car parks - paid car parks cser to the centre and free further out - so it usuay ony takes a few minutes..., France This Way review: we are enthusiastic about various viages in France, and we have visited hundreds, but Moustiers-Sainte-Marie is one of our very favourite viages in France and we urge you to visit if possibe!, , The ayout of Moustiers-Sainte-Marie is defined by its geography: a canyon crosses the centre of the viage, with the main viage centre across the gorge, the historic centre mosty to the eft of here, and the path to the famous chape eading up the gorge., Moustiers is much more ivey than many viages, a tribute to its natura beauty and the number of visitors it attracts. There are numerous shops, cafes and restaurants both in the narrow streets of the historic centre and in the main centre of the viage. There is aso a great dea to enjoy in terms of historica and scenic interest, with the streets containing numerous attractive houses and babbing fountains., Apart from the genera atmosphere you wi note particuary the medieva Church of Notre-Dame de Assomption with its decorative four-storey square betower, the most important historica monument in Moustiers., The church was originay buit in the 12th century and retains part of its origina roman stye, athough significant modifications were made in the 16th century (hence the gothic stye reinforcements on the side of the church). Behind the church is a pretty square with a fountain, the tourist office of Moustiers-Sainte-Marie and a view across the gorge., You can aso see part of the origina defensive ramparts in Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, whie a natura scenic highight is the waterfa in the viage centre that resuts from a stream emerging from the bottom of the ciff., Before tourism became the dominant industry here Moustiers had a ng history of making attractive pottery (fayence), a tradition that continues to this day and which you wi see in some of the numerous workshops in the viage. There is aso a museum dedicated to the history of the pottery making in the Moustiers., Wherever you are in Moustiers-Sainte-Marie you can see a arge shining star suspended above the gap between the two ciffs. There has been a star suspended here for severa centuries, athough it has been repaced a few times fowing damage and coapse. The current star is 115 centimetres across., The origins of the star are unknown and there are various egends and stories. My own favourite is that two vers that were kept apart by their warring famiies committed suicide by jumping from the ciffs, prompting their famiies to suspend the star. You wi hear various other versions when you visit..., Athough the heat might deter you, you reay do need to wak up the ng fight of steps behind the viage to the 12th century Chape Notre-Dame-de-Beauvoir. It is not as far or difficut as it oks, and as we as seeing the chape you aso get vey views across the rooftops of Moustiers., The main path to the chape eaves the viage from the right of the gorge, next to the cemetery and the Chape of Sainte-Anne*., , Take a deviation to see the Chape of Sainte-Anne, mosty to see the far-reaching view across the countryside of the Maire Vaey to the ac de Sainte-Croix and beyond., The Chape Notre-Dame-de-Beauvoir dates from the 9th century, athough the odest part remaining today, the nave, was buit in the 13th century and the rest of the buiding in the 16th century. Among other highights see the woodwork of the door and the courfu ties used on the roof of the porch., The chape was a very popuar pigrimage centre in midde ages, and in the 17th century was known as a chape where sti-born chidren woud return to ife for a few moments, giving them the chance to be baptised and their sous to go to heaven, before being buried in the cemetery., When returning towards Moustiers-Sainte-Marie from the\xa0Chape Notre-Dame-de-Beauvoir we suggest you take the aternative path: turn right about 100 metres after eaving the chape and take the path that aso passes the Grotte Sainte Madeeine. Of course you can aso reach the chape from the viage ang this path, but the start is not at a ceary signposted in the viage centre and the path is much ess we maintained than the main path, so we recommend it for the return ony., This path brings you back into the viage near the fortified gate caed the Porte du Riou, and the Cascade de Riou just outside the gate (athough the waterfa might be rather dry if you visit in the summer!), , Nobody wi visit the region without aso expring the\xa0Gorges du Verdon and the ac de Sainte-Croix: it is these two natura highights that attract visitors to the region and together with Moustiers-Sainte-Marie make this a very popuar trave destination., ess we known, the viage is aso part of the avender Route across the Vaensoe pateau, which is a vey way to see the famous avender fieds of the region, and some of the ess visited towns and viages., You can find more trave ideas in the Apes-de-Haute-Provence guide and the Provence guide., ",43.846,6.2218

It was an important regiona centre during the eary midde ages., France This Way review: Orthez does not have a great dea of historic interest to see except the bridge, but the view ang to the river to the bridge is very vey and the town is peasant for a stro if you are in this region., Note: Orthez Tourist Office is now on the Pace dArmes, and no nger in the Maison Jeanne dAbret., , The 13th-14th century stone bridge across the Gave de Pau (the river), is undoubtedy the most impressive sight in the town. It has an unusua gateway-tower hafway across the arched bridge: the bridge originay had two of these defensive towers, and the centra part of the bridge was connected to the river banks by wooden patforms which coud easiy be removed if the town was attacked., The bridge successfuy protected the town on two occasions: the first in 1569 during the Wars of Reigion, and then again in 1814 when the bridge successfuy resisted the troops of Weinton, as he pursued a retreating Napoeon., As we as the street that approaches the bridge there are two other paces with better views of the bridge and river: you can access the river bank next to the bridge and wak a short distance ang the river, and you can aso stand on the Pont Neuf, the newer bridge a short distance to the east of this bridge, for a vey view of both the Gave de Pau and the bridge., Custered around the end of the bridge you can see some interesting medieva houses athough this area of Orthez is not very deveped, perhaps because the raiway ine aso fows the edge of the river., From here you can wak into the town centre, with various sma shops and restaurants.

Athough Ottmarsheim is quite sma it is we maintained and there are severa medieva haf-timbered houses to be seen in the streets cse to the church., Dating originay from the first haf of the 11th century, the Church of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Pau originay formed part of a benedictine abbey that was buit here by Rodophe dAtenbourg, a weathy ca andowner. It is unusua in being octagona in design*, and a very impressive exampe of the roman stye of church architecture that is amost competey acking superfuous decoration., , It is aso thought to be the odest church in Asace (indeed it is aso one of the odest buidings to be found in the whoe region). However, two important fires in the midde ages, the Thirty Years War, the French revoution and a fire in 1991 have a caused damage to the church - so the many modifications and renovations carried out across the centuries mean that part of what we now see dates from ater centuries., Inside the abbey church, each side of the octagona body has a arge arched opening., There are a series of muras in the church at Ottmarsheim, dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. One of the most impressive features the symbos of the four evangeists (an ange for Saint Matthew, a cow for Saint uke, an eage for Saint John and a ion for Saint Mark), whie another shows Christ on a rainbow betwen heaven and earth., In the open square in front of the church you can see two traditiona haf-timbered houses., , * Note: the octagona design is usuay considered to be a copy of the church of Aix-a-Chapee (found in Germany),athough other sources that suggest the Paatine Chape in Aachen or the Saint-Vita church in Ravenne, Itay are the inspiration for the design of the abbey church at Ottmarsheim., One pace that wi be of particuar interest to those interested in the history of the region is the Asace Ecomuseum at Ungersheim where ts of period houses and buidings have been reassembed to create an authentic medieva Asace viage., You can find more trave ideas in the Haut-Rhin guide and the Asace guide., Booking.com: best prices, For great prices on car hire throughout France and Corsica pease visit our recommended partner at RentaCars.com, Muhouse, Often ignored as an industria town Muhouse actuay has an attractive centre around the Pace de a Reunion and severa important museums, Ungersheim, The Ecomuseum at Ungershim is a fascinating reconstruction of an entire medieva Asace viage using buidings from across the region, Soutz-Haut-Rhin, In Soutz-Haut-Rhin an unusua characteristic is that many of the od houses are in stone rather than haf-timbered as is common in the region, Rouffach, Perhaps ess exceptiona than some Asace towns we sti enjoyed expring the centre of Rouffach, Neuf-Brisach, Neuf-Brisach is unique in being a town that was entirey designed by Vauban, an important 18th century miitary engineer, Guebwier, In Guebwier it is the part of the town ang the cana and aso the churches that are the highight for visitors, ... or see A recommended paces to visit in Haut-Rhin, Address: Ottmarsheim, Izach, Muhouse, Asace, 68490, France || GPS coordinates: atitude 47.7881, ngitude 7.51111, The French version of this page is at Ottmarsheim (Francais), We can hep you visit any town, viage or region of France..., ① Ideas & inspiration ② Maps of France ③ Expre by region ④ Route panner ⑤ Paces (by dept.), France This Way copyright 2006 - 202",47.7881,7.51111

The emphasis is more on tourist boats now but there is sti an active fish market., France This Way review: athough there are not many historic buidings compared to many of the towns in the region, Paimpo is quite attractive and a stro around the harbour or a visit to the weeky market is a peasant way to pass a morning, The heart of Paimpo is centred around the harbour and the streets of the historic centre. Start your visit with a stro around the harbour admiring the 17th century stone houses and the mix of peasure boats and fishing boats tied up around the harbour., Note: there are actuay two arge harbours in Paimpo (Bassin 1 and Bassin 2), adjacent to each other and with fishing boats in Bassin 1 and peasure boats in both harbours. Bassin 1 is oder and surrounded by the oder granite houses., , Ang one side of the harbour the houses are newer but aso attractive - I noticed when okng at our earier photos of the same harbour that the houses were previousy quite a neutra cour but they have now been painted to provide a courfu backdrop: this is a trend we have seen in a few towns, party because photos of courfu houses are much more popuar on socia media (facebook, instagram etc)!, After expring the harbour head into the od town with its traditiona stone houses, a few haf-timbered houses and cobbed streets. There are various attractive houses to see, especiay around Pace du Martray, Rue des Huit Patriotes and Rue des Isandais., Have a ok in particuar at the 15th century ‘Maison Jezeque’ on a Rue des Huit Patriotes: this is one of the odest houses in the town and was once a shop suppying the cod fishing industry. Another notabe sight is the Maison des Armateurs, one of the grandest stone townhouses in Paimpo., Athough there are some historic buidings, there is quite a t of more recent devepment in the centre of Paimpo, so if possibe we recommend you visit on market day (Tuesday) when the extensive market around the Pace des Haes provides a courfu and ivey scene for the town., The od tower in the town centre is a that remains of the 18th century church that once stood here. Apparenty it was not generay thought to be an attractive buiding so it was repaced by the Church of the Notre Dame de Bonne Nouvee at the beginning of the 20th century. Personay I woudnt say the repacement is very vey either but each to his own! Two coumns at the base of the tower date from 1550, and an even earier church in the same cation., There is a sma museum in Paimpo - the Musée de a Mer - commemorating its history as an important cod fishing port and particuary the ives of the ‘Iceanders’ as the fishermen who went on the ng fishing trips to Iceand were caed.

The idea of course is to have time to visit both, and the view of Pein on the hi as you approach the viage is quite extraordinary!, You wont need your car in the viage itsef (in any case it is pedestrianised), athough sturdy shoes might be appropriate for cimbing the cobbed pathways, steps and aeys!, , The houses cing to the rock, amost seeming to form part of the andscape, making Pein a\xa0 sma but fascinating viage and a vey pace to visit., A the ingredients are here that you woud expect from a Provenca perched viage - steep streets ined with unchanged medieva houses wind up and down throughout Pein, often passing through vauted passageways., As you enter the viage you can fow the Carriera soutrana to the right which is amost an underground street it has so many vauted sections., The viage is one of the most successfu in the region at offering a fascinating insight into how ife might have been 500 years ago for inhabitants of this remote cation, and there are numerous features of historica interest and beauty to discover as you expre., One particuar highight in Pein is found inside the Chape of Penitents-Bancs, where there are some highy regarded 15th century frescoes to admire, painted by Jean Canavesio (you can see more Canavesio frescoes at the Chape Notre-Dame des Fontaines near a Brigue).

Go to the tourist office when you arrive and ask for their ‘carte touristique’ to make sure you don’t miss anything: I had been to Perigueux twice on shopping trips before reaising what a beautifu medieva centre it has!, , Arriving in Perigueux the first thing to attract your attention is the amazing Saint Front Cathedra which dominates the town centre. The origina church was buit in about 1120 and changed in the 19th century by Pau Abadie who used it as a mode for the design of the Sacre Coeur church in Montmarte., Its ayout is in the shape of the Greek cross, simiar to St Mark’s in Venice, and above the centre and each arm a vey domed roof (cupoa) has been added. Apparenty architects and cas do not ike the changes and prefer the more traditiona Romanesque church of St Etienne de a Cité, which used to be the cathedra of Perigueux., For my part I think it is a beautifu buiding though it is very austere inside. The cathedra was cassified as a Unesco Word Heritage Site in 1998 as an important stage on the St James of Compostea Pigrimage., See Perigueux cathedra for more information., Upon entering the medieva town next to the cathedra you wi see the Mataguerre Tower.

Throughout the medieva centre of Perigueux there are various exampes of houses that were owned by weathy merchants., Rue imogeanne is one of the best streets and has severa haf-timbered houses.

Inside is a superb stone staircase. It is made of the white imestone for which the region is famous and for which this part of the Perigord is caed white Perigord (e Perigord Banc)., At no 12 on the same street you can see the Hote Meredieu, a vey 15th century town house. Note: Hote here means weathy residence rather than hote in the modern sense., The Rue Eguierie (Threadneede Street) eads to the 14th century Maison du Patissier which has a very fine 16th century door and was once the residence of a we-known patissier who made the famous Perigueux ‘Paté de foie gras’. Rue Mignot is a narrow passage which was used in the fiming of ‘Jacqou e Croquant’ a popuar fim in France directed by Steio renzi., The centre of Perigueux has ts of itte squares, many of which have restaurants whose tabes spi into the square inviting you to stop and have unch., , Roman Perigueux, to the west of the current town centre, is smaer than the medieva centre but is fascinating.

The church was originay buit before 1423 but during a siege of the viage in 1468 the church was destroyed by the inhabitants of the viage in order to repair and improve their remparts. They managed to withstand the attack and one year ater started rebuiding the church which was competed in 1479., The main street of Perouges is the Rue des Rondes and this runs in a circe around the centre of the viage. At one part there is a narrow strip, by the houses, which is higher than the rest and was reserved for the weathy residents of the viage.

Perpignans medieva centre has a distincty Cataan fee., The medieva centre of Perpignan is charming. The river Basse runs through the city centre and has beautifuy panted gardens running ang its edge. To the south of the river narrow streets and open squares entice the traveer to expre the city centre., France This Way review: Perpignan is idea for visitors oking for a typica norma French town to simpy spend some time, ok in some shops, take a drink, reax and expre., , The medieva centre is quite sma and easy to visit in a haf a day. On the edge of the od centre is the Paace of the Kings of Majorca, a very attractive buiding with a moorish air. The part of the town between the 14th century entrance gate at Castiet and the Pace de a ge, and then south to the Paace of the Kings of Majorca, is the most interesting for visitors, and there are severa attractive medieva buidings dotted around this centra section., On the edge of the river Basse and the Pace de a Victoire is the the city gate caed the Castiet. Buit in the 14th century it has aso been used as a prison. The Porte Notre Dame was added by uis XI and Castiet is now home to the Museum of Cataan History., The Hote de Vie, caed the ge de Mer, was buit over the 13th, 16th and 17th centuries and was originay the stock exchange. In its courtyard is one of Mais statues, a Mediterranee., The narrow Pace de a ge with its red marbe fors and seection of restaurants is an attractive spot and was a favourite meeting point for refugees feeing France for Spain during the Second Word War., Perpignans cathedrae Saint-Jean-Baptiste was buit in the 14th century in a Gothic stye athough it did not become a cathedra unti 1601. The cathedra was buit in a stye with a Cataan infuence especiay its ornate campanie., Be sure to ok inside the cathedra as it has retained the paintwork that used to be in amost a churches. It is beautifu and gives the cathedra a very warm and wecoming atmosphere., Next to the cathedra the Campo Santo is an unusua cister-cemetery. It is the ony one in France.\xa0 As it has a arge open centre it is often used for concerts in the summer. In front of the cathedra you can see a vey square surrounded by ta brick buidings with pae, painted shutters and ornate baconies., The highight of Perpignan is its vey Paace of the Kings of Majorca (Paais des rois de Majorque). This was buit in the 13th century for the court of Jacques II of Majorca and is a mix of civi and miitary architecture. It is buit of a vey red brick and from its was you get some exceent views over the city and surrounding area., In the 17th century Vauban, a famous French miitary architect,\xa0 updated the miitary defences of the paace. He aso buit defensive was around Perpignan but these were removed as the city grew., , Be sure to expre the narrow aeys around the cathedra in the Arab Quarter, for a taste of a different Perpignan.

The sme of the herbs and spices is deicious., Perpignan has a decent art gaery, the Musee des Beaux-Arts Hyacinthe Rigaud, whose coection incudes works by Mai, Picasso, Miro and Dufy. This is housed in an 18th century mansion. Another interesting buiding is the Casa Xano which is a 16th century mansion and the ony gothic house remaining in Perpignan. Its facade is scupted with a frieze showing the seven deady sins., Perpignan is a good pace to stay if you are hoping to expre the western Pyrenees a itte, with a chance to enjoy picturesque viages, mountain scenery and historic monuments such as the cathar castes.

Many of the beaches ang this stretch of coast are rather overdeveped and a bit featureess, but we didnt visit a of them, and they are fine if you have chidren want to see the sea.

No probem but you might need to check when you visit that your accommodation is where you want it to be!, , There are two main beaches in the town, both on the north side of the peninsua and quite different in character., I think most visitors wi want to spend more time on the Page de Trestraou but wi certainy aso want to vist the other beach during a visit. Parking can be a chaenge but drive around ng enough and something shoud turn up!, The beach photo of Perros-Guirec that you wi often see in tourist marketing materias and in our main picture above is of the Page de Trestigne, taken from the bevedere on the hi (on Bouevard Georges Cémenceau) about 100 metres west of the beach., Perros-Guirec is not perhaps an exciting town from a historica point of view, having deveped argey as a resort due to its great cation. However, the town centre is peasant and during the summer the centre of Perros-Guirec is ivey and you wi find severa cafes, shops and a wide range of choices of paces to stay., The church of Saint-Jacques in the centre of Perros-Guirec is interesting to visit, and as we as rows of stone arches in the romanesque stye separating the nave from the side aises you can see an impressive atar and severa painted wooden statues., Another church in the town is the Chape Notre-Dame-de-a-Carté which aso contains severa painted wooden status from the 17th century as we as wooden doors with ancient carvings among its highights., In the part of Perros-Guirec between the town centre and the beach the streets are ined with pam-trees and stone vias with sate rooves. You wi see on maps of the town that there is a port to the east, but this is not a major tourist attraction., Note that because Pumanach is a few kimetres away we have treated it as a separate cation - see the Pumanach guide for information., , You can take the coasta path which runs from the beach (Page de Trestraou) in Perros-Guirec around to the fishing viage at Pumanach and on to Pointe de Squewe.

This particuar stretch has ts of rocks scupted into fabuus shapes by the sea., If you are ever in Perros-Guirec in eary summer you reay must take a boat trip out to the Sept Ies which has become an amazing bird sanctuary.

The town was originay an important regiona centre, but over the centuries Pertuis st this roe to Aix-en-Provence, 25 kimetres south of here., France This Way review: Pertuis is quite a minor destination, especiay since there are so many exceptiona towns and viages cse by, but there are severa sma sites of interest and the town has more shops and restaurants than many towns paces nearby, so worth a visit and a stro if you are here., , Start your visit in the main square in the center of the town, Pace Mirabeau, where you can visit Pertuis Tourist Information Office and get a map that suggests a route to fow as you expre the town: this is very usefu since most of the highights are quite minor and rather hidden in the back streets of the town!, One of the most important monuments in Pertuis, aso here in the main square, is the Church of Saint-Nicoas. This church was buit in the 16th century on the site of an earier church and incudes an important 16th century triptych and two marbe statues from the 17th century., Aso in the square you can see the statue of Mirabeau and the donjon (tower), now aso a ccktower, that dominates the skyine of Pertuis. This tower is a that remains of a 12th century caste that once stood here, the remainder having been removed as the town expanded in the centuries after the end of the Wars of Reigion in 1596.

The most important is the Maison de a Reine Jeanne in the renaissance stye and in Rue Beaujeu, a short distance north of Pace Mirabeau., In Pace de Ange, heart of Pertuis in the 17th century, you can see one of the odest fountains in the town. It is specuated that the fountain once had an ange on top, giving the name to the square, but there is no evidence to support this. On the south-west edge of the town you can see the Saint-Jacques Tower, buit in the 14th century as part of the defences of Pertuis, but now rather surrounded by more recent devepment., , One unusua feature is to be seen on a house in Rue Droite, where a arge stone is inserted in the opening in the facade that was where the merchant woud originay have paced his produce to attract customers. Not a remarkabe sight perhaps, but I dont reca seeing this anywhere ese and the ancient street and doorway do hep to evoque Pertuis in the 16th century., There are severa remarkabe viages and towns within easy reach of Pertuis incuding the vey viages of urmarin and Ansouis and the vibrant town of Aix-en-Provence among others..., You can find more trave ideas in the Vaucuse guide and the Provence guide., ",43.695,5.5036111

This aso of course aws you to easiy visit that town, which is a arge and interesting pace with ts to enjoy., The resort of Porticcio is cean and modern, and accommodation is avaiabe here that is often cheaper than the better known resorts in Corsica. However, you shoud be aware that Porticcio acks a historic centre to give it character, and is not very cse to the we known attractions of the isand. As a resut it is perhaps a suitabe destination if your main requirement is to spend a few days in the Corsican sunshine, but ess so if you want to enjoy the magnificent scenery and beaches that have made Corsica famous., There are severa beaches in the town.

Happiy these are quite sma and create the impression of a viage with a hoiday atmosphere rather than of a seaside resort. Behind the hotes the pretty river vaey and the oming ta mountains create a spectacuar backdrop., , There is a sma group of oder houses at each end of the main road: it is the end near the port which is of interest to visitors. In this part of Porto there is a very sma area that was the historic viage and now contains shops and restaurants, as we as severa ticket offices where you can book your boat trips ang the coast., As far as I coud see, a the companies charged the same price for the same trips and there are never ast-minute reductions if paces remain avaiabe - so there is not a t of point in shopping around!, At the end of the headand there is an ancient tower. There is a sma charge to pay to enter the tower but the the chance to wak out ang the headand and the views from the top of the tower, both out to sea and back across the viage, justify the expense., After expring this part of the viage, take a stro through the busting waterfront in Porto. This is where tourists set off on one of the many boat trips avaiabe and is aways busting with activity. The other side of the port there is a sandy beach. Not perhaps the best beach in Corsica but very convenient for visitors., , It is the scenery and activities in the surrounding mountains that are of course the main attraction in Porto.

The town aso has easy access to both beautifu beaches and high mountain scenery, which expains its popuarity with visitors to Corsica., The marina part of the town is buit on ex-sat marshes and sat continues to pay an important roe in the ife of Porto-Vecchio. It was because of the marshes that this region was not deveped earier, since they were infested with mosquitoes and maaria unti we into the 20th century, athouth the citade on the hi dates back to the 16th century., During the mid-20th century the marshes were drained, which in combination with improved communication inks has enabed the town to devep its current roe as a seaside resort., The town of Porto Vecchio has two distinct areas to expre: the citade and od town, and the marina. Start your visit with a stro around the marina.

From here you can wak up the hi to the citade., , Within the od town there is a numbered trai that you can fow to see the important highights, but in truth the town centre is quite sma and as you wander around you wi see the sites of interest anyway. The citade and streets of the od town date from the 16th century, when the Genoese controed Corsica., Within Porto-Vecchio od town around the Pace de a Repubique you can discover the origina defences and ramparts, some vey od buidings pressing in on narrow streets and squares of picturesque houses. One of the best known sights in the\xa0Pace de a Repubique is the tropica tree caed the Be Ombra that was given to the town in 1901 and is now 10 metres across., The Church of Saint-John-the-Baptist was buit in the 19th century and rather pain on the outside, because the funds ran out before the facade was competed. Step inside to see the ornatey decorated interior, then return to the Pace de a Repubique to visit one of the cafes in the square., Another highight is the picturesque Pace Ettori, off Cours Napoeon. The od house with a big staircase in this square was once the hospita for the Genoise troops., There are vey views from the defensive bastions, and the od town comes to ife with music and entertainment during summer evenings, which is a good time to enjoy the town at its best. If you visit in September you can watch the annua sat harvest from the Porte Gènoise, the origina entrance to the citade., France This Way review: athough it is a very peasant town with a ivey atmosphere, Porto-Vecchio is aso smaer than we expected and there are not many important historic monuments. So a good town to enjoy the atmosphere but one that doesnt take ng to expre., , Above a it is the beaches and coastine around the town that are the big attraction, with severa stunning beaches in the bays ang the nearby coast in both directions, typicay beaches of fine sand, with the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean backed by extensive pine forests. The beaches to the south of Porto-Vecchio are most popuar with visitors., The beach at Pambaggia to the south of Porto-Vecchio is internationay renowned as one of the most beautifu beaches in Corsica, with other popuar beaches ang this stretch of coast incuding Santa Giuia, a itte further south, Tamaricciu, and other smaer beaches between the two., Heading north from the town the most important beaches are those at Caa Rossa, then Saint-Cyprien and Pinareu a itte further north.

860,France,Rocamadour,"Rocamadour is a viage in the t department of the Occitanie region, near the eastern border of the\xa0Dordogne department. Situated in the Causses du Quercy Regiona Natura Park, Rocamadour receives more than a miion visitors - tourists and pigrims - each year., Athough the history of the viage dates back to prehistoric times, it is as a medieva pigrimage destination that Rocamadour is best known, with the first church here being constructed in the midde of the 12th century., France This Way review: Rocamadour, athough a sma viage, is an amazing pace to visit both for its cation and its monuments. The viage is buit on the edge of a ciff, with the river Azou bew at the bottom of the gorge, and the houses and monuments are a beautifuy preserved and renovated., , Because of its many attributes Rocamadour is aso one of the most visited destinations in France. If you want some degree of soitude you wi have to get here quite eary in the morning or out of season but if that is not possibe it is sti we worth a visit when you are in the region, despite the crowds!, The ayout of the viage is that Rocamadour has a caste above the viage; the sanctuary further down the hi; the main pedestrianised viage sti further down the hi and reached by the Grand Escaier; and then the gorges that ead down to the river., Your first decision when you visit is where to park! There are car parks both above the viage near the caste, and bew the viage near the river., There are two ifts avaiabe - between the ramparts and the sanctuary, and betwen the sanctuary and the viage. We thought these were rather expensive\xa0 - four euros for one adut to go one way from the viage to the chateau, for exampe - but are usefu if you want to avoid a t of uphi waking., At the highest point of Rocamadour you can wak around the ramparts to get a remarkabe view of the viage down bew. From here you can wak down the Rocamadour Chemin de Croix, a shady wak down the hiside where you can see the Stations of the Cross as you make your way down., At the bottom of the footpath you arrive at the reigious centre of the viage with the sanctuary of Rocamadour. As an ensembe of reigious buidings this has a very itaianate fee with ts of arches and stone baustrades., The Basiique Saint Sauveur is the argest of the seven churches and chapes and receives pigrims to the viage. It has a wooden gaery at the back which is very simiar to those in the Basque region, and was added so that the church coud hod the many pigrims that visited., The Back Madonna is in the Chapee Notre Dame, a sma chape in buit in gothic stye in 1479 after a rock fe into the origina sanctuary and the most interesting and beautifuy decorated of the chapes here. The back madonna, is thought to have been carved in the 11th century. Above the door on the outside is the sword of Duranda embedded in the stone., Between the viage of Rocamadour and the sanctuary,\xa0the Grand Escaier has more than 200 steps. Originay pigrims cimbed up these steps to the churches on their knees., There are sti four of the origina stone gates in the town: from west to east these are Porte Basse, Porte Hugon, Porte Samon and Porte Figuier., The main viage in Rocamadour ies ang one road and is very pretty with its stone houses, the arched stone gates and view of the gorge above. Most of the houses are now shops and restaurants. The shops are very much dedicated to tourists though there are some interesting itte boutiques amongst them. The centre of Rocamadour is entirey pedestrianised., , A knowedge of the history of the viage wi greaty enhance your visit to Rocamadour. The story starts in 1166 when the preserved body of a hermit, reputed to be Saint Amadour, was discovered here. Saint Amadour is reputed to be Zaccheus, the inn keeper who cimbed the tree to see Jesus and whose wife Saint Veronica wiped the face of Jesus with a handkerchief whist he carried the cross., After the death of his wife Zaccheus came to Rocamadour as a hermit. He buit a sanctuary in the rock and cas caed him Amator (’the ver’) because of his devotion. Hence Rocamadour was named after the rock of Amator. Within a few years of the body being found numerous miracuus heaings were attributed to the sainty remains. Pigrims started arriving - and kept arriving!, The Back Madonna and the shrine became the main attraction for pigrims and the town grew weathy under the important patronage of kings and nobes of the time. Henry II of Engand was one of the first to come and donate a t of treasure. The hospitas and churches, and the viage of Rocamadour itsef, grew to cope with the infux of pigrims, as did the grand staircase which pigrims cimbed on their knees to reach the viage., By the 16th century the number of pigrims had dwinded, and the Wars of Reigion had caused great damage to the viage, and it was not unti the 19th century that the Rocamadour we see now - a charming and popuar destination - took shape., As you expre you can aso visit the Museum of Sacred Art, and see the tapestries inside the Town Ha, by Jean urçat., There are many beautifu views of Rocamadour from just outside the viage, and the most popuar is perhaps the view from Hospitaet a short distance east of the main viage. In Hospitaet you can aso see a sma 13th century chape and the remains of the origina medieva hospita that gave the hamet its name., , Rocamadour is just 15 minutes from the magnificent cave system of the Gouffre de Padirac.

908,France,Saint-Cirq-apopie,"The vey viage of Saint-Cirq-apopie is isted among the most beautifu viages of France. The viage is situated 20 kimetres east of Cahors in the t region of France and fas within the Causses du Quercy Regiona Natura Parc., France This Way review: in our opinion, the stunning position of Saint-Cirq-apope, perched over the t River, and the historic centre of the viage make it one of the most beautifu of the beautifu viages of France., Due to its situation between the river and the ciffs parking is a chaenge when you visit Saint-Cirq-apopie: the ony parking cse to the viage centre is marked P4 whie the other car parks are a few hundred metres from the centre, which can then be reached by footpath or with a specia tourist bus., You enter the viage from above and descend through the medieva streets, but before heading into the historic centre we suggest you fow the main road down the hi: this road has many exceptiona views of the viage and is one of the high points of a visit to Saint-Cirq-apopie., , On a protruding ciff at the highest part of the viage you can see the remains of the three fortresses that once stood here., Athough itte remains of the actua castes, you sti fee a great sense of history and of course the views are very impressive: the castes are on a protruding ciff and you have views in both directions ang the t Vaey as we as across the viage rooftops, views that you cant see from anywhere ese in Saint-Cirq-apopie., Just bew the castes you can see an impressive 15th century roman stye church. The interior of the church was a disappointment but the outside is impressive and dominates many views of the viage., From here you can now expre the historic centre of the viage. The narrow cobbed streets of Saint-Cirq-apopie contain a vey mixture of medieva houses, some in combage (haf-timbered) and some in the yew stone typica of the region., Many of the houses we see today date from the 13th to 16th century and often have sma terraced gardens that add to the overa beauty of the viage.., There are aso severa restaurants in the viage centre: in fact amost a the restaurants in the viage are good quaity so aw penty of time for unch!, We dont often recommend sma ca museums in French towns but one notabe museum in Saint-Cirq-apopie is the Rignaut Museum, a carefuy restored viage house and guardhouse that aso has a vey garden and amazing views ang the river vaey., Bew the viage next to the river there are an assortment of od mis and buidings testifying to the activity of the viage in centuries gone by, and you can enjoy this by fowing ang the ancient tow path next to the river t., A short distance east of the viage there is a eisure area with a river beach., , Nowadays Saint-Cirq-apopie is home to numerous artists and artisans, many with sma shops and boutiques in the centre. This trend started perhaps when Andre Breton made his home here and decared that he had, as a consequence, stopped wanting to go anywhere ese., France This Way review: Saint-Cirq-apopie is one of the most popuar tourist destinations in the t area and shoud not be missed if you visiting the region. As with many of the most beautifu viages it is best seen eary in the morning - for the better ight, and for the smaer numbers of tourists busting around., If you are staying nearby you wi want to return more than once: for exampe the viage has a quite different character first thing in the morning with the mist rising off the river, or after dark when the caste and viage is it up., The quiet viage we see today is very different to the town that stood here in the Midde Ages. At that time for severa centuries it was an important regiona centre within the historic Quercy region and home to the apopie, Cardaiac and Gourdon rds., Its roe originay deveped in part because of its position on one of the important pigrimage paths to Santiago de Compostee that cross France. Saint-Cirq-apopie aso payed an important roe in the Abigensian crusades against the cathars, the Hundred Years War and the Wars of reigion., , The tow path in the viage (signed Chemin de Haage de Gain) continues about five kimetres west to Bouzigues. In part carved into the rockface, this is an exceptiona wak ang the river and highy recommended., Severa different feuda dynasties ived in Saint-Cirq-apopie in the Midde ages, which is why there are so many castes in and near the town. These incude the imposing renaissance Caste of Cénevières, furnished in period stye and in a raised position with vey views across the t vaey as we as various castes buit in inaccessibe paces in the ciffs ang the t and Céé vaeys, together referred to as the Castes of the Engish., Other nearby paces of interest incude the prehistoric caves of Pech-Mere at Cabrerets and the Chateau de arnago., Much of the surrounding t Vaey is aso worth expring: we first discovered Saint-Cirq-apopie as part of a journey between Figeac and Cahors ang the wer t Vaey, which was very peasant., Expre esewhere in the Massif Centra.

909,France,Saint-Come-d'Ot,"Saint-Come dOt is a viage about 25 kimetres north-east of Rodez, in the Aveyron department of the Midi-Pyrenees on the banks of the t River. The viage is cassed as one of the most beautifu viages in France and is on the popuar pigrimage route that eads from e Puy-en-Veay to Santiago de Compostea (in Spain)., France This Way review: the more recent bouevards that surround Saint-Come dOt rather hide the medieva centre but when you discover the historic area you wi find it to be a very pretty viage, and we worth a visit if you are in the region., The viage has a simpe ayout, unchanged for severa centuries, with a circe of houses surrounding a centra church and square. The ring of houses aso originay heped provide the fortifications of the viage., , You can enter the historic centre of Saint-Come-dOt through one of the origina gateways through the fortifications: these are the Porte Neuve, the Porte Maimande and the Porte Theron (the first two are origina whie the third is a reconstruction, identica to the origina gateway). This part of the viage is very compact and has ts of attractive medieva buidings squeezed in to the sma space around the church and the surrounding streets., The church of Saint-Come-dOt in the centre of the viage was reconstructed in the eary 16th century in the gothic stye. A very unusua aspect of the church is the spire, which is twisted (perhaps not the technica term!) from top to bottom - there are very few churches of the design to be found (in fact no one even knows if the design is intentiona or accidenta.), Before entering ok at the heavy and ornamented wooden doors and statues in the entrance: the doors feature beautifu carvings in their top panes. Inside the church there are severa interesting artworks and scuptures, from the 15th century onwards., The other main buiding in the centre is the Chateau de Castenau. The caste was buit in the 12th century, the towers were added in the 14th century, and the buiding was substantiay modified in the renaissance stye during the 15th century to make it more comfortabe for iving in. Apart from the towers it has the appearance of a manor house rather than a medieva caste, in part because the southern face of the caste was rebuit in the 19th century when it was in use as a reigious centre., The caste is currenty used as the town ha for Saint-Come-dOt., Outside the historic centre, you wi fnd various shops and restaurants ang the broader streets that encirce Saint-Come-dOt as we as penty of parking spaces. Stro down to the river and cross the bridge for a nice view back across the river and rooftops of Saint-Come-dOt., You can aso see the Chape of Penitents on the edge of the viage. This roman stye church was originay the main church for the parish, and the destination for pigrims passing through. The porch and sma betower are more recent additions to the chape (15th and 18th century respectivey)., Just ang the Rue de a Bouisse from the chape is a sma memoria caed the Ouradou. This was erected in tribute to those who died when the pague arrived in the viage in 1586, kiing three quarters of the popuation., , After expring Saint-Come-dOt take a drive up the hi opposite to see the ava fw - a curious sight, where an enormous river of rock spreads down the hiside, surrounded by trees and fieds. A very unusua and interesting sight, a nice picnic spot angside, and your chidren can enjoy cambering over the massive rocks!, There are numerous other viages in the t vaey and surrounding countryside of the Aubrac region - among those cse by in the t Vaey you can visit Espaion, Sainte-Euaie dOt and Estaing (the ast two are aso cassified among the most beautifu viages of France).

910,France,Saint-Cyprien,"Saint-Cyprien is situated in the Dordogne department just north of the River Dordogne, between ainde and Sarat., The main street in St Cyprien is the Rue Gambetta. This is an eegant street with attractive houses, ts of wrought iron baconies and detaied stone work and is packed with bars and restaurants and nice oking boutiques. But head behind here to the Pace de a iberte and you enter the beautifu medieva od town of St Cyprien., , eading up from the Pace de a iberte to the ancient Abbey you can fow the vey Rue du Terme. In this street you wi notive a arge Perigordine mansion house on the right and ts of other charming buidings surrounding it., Continue cimbing upwards and admire the vey buidings as you go; a mix of goden stone houses and haf-timbered buidings ine the streets. Heading up above the main part of the town you enter the ‘Montmartre’ area of Saint-Cyprien. Here the streets are steep and narrow and the buidings are buit on a more modest scae., They give the impression of having been squeezed into a sma space and indeed these are houses buit inside the city was when space for buidings was running out. This was because Saint-Cyprien occupied a border position between Eeanor’s Aquitaine and the French armies and was under attack during the Hundred Year’s War and the Wars of Reigion., The views from the Montmartre area over the Dordogne vaey and St Cyprien itsef are superb., The Abbey church of St Cyprien is aso in an eevated position. The be-tower keep survives from the 12th century but the rest of the Abbey was burnt down in the wars of reigion and rebuit in 1685. Inside the church is an atar which contained one of the thorns of Jesus’ crown, brought here by a Femish nun feeing revoution terror. Unfortunatey this was robbed in 1997!, Bew the abbey are more sma anes which are known as the sewing district and the Pace des Oies (geese) was originay the market pace dedicated to poutry., Market day at St Cyprien is a Sunday., , There are numerous paces of interest and activities in the Dordogne area cse to Saint-Cyprien, from expring od castes to visiting prehistoric caves - see our detaied Dordogne guide for detais., Among our favourites are or canoe trips ang the river, visiting the prehistoric paintings in the caves at Font de Gaume and the viage and caste at Beynac, a in cse proximity to Saint-Cyprien., You can find more trave ideas in the Dordogne guide and the Aquitaine guide., ",44.8706,1.04444

Originay severa viages that have now merged into one town, the ports of es ecques and a Madrague are now considered part of the same community, and es ecques is the region with the main beach resort., France This Way review: Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer is a peasant resort for those searching for a destination with an accessibe beach and seafront cafes and activities in easy reach, but there is not a t ese to do in the town so personay we woud choose to be somewhere a bit more varied such as Sanary-sur-Mer...but we are not beach enthusiasts!, , On arriving in Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer the first thing that strikes you is the attractive coasta setting, backed by a mix of pine forests and vineyards. The seafront here incudes a peasant beach and the peasure ports, and there are numerous restaurants ang the coast and near the ports., There are three ports ang the coast at Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer: the Vieux Port des ecques and the Nouveau Port des ecques are next to each other at the nothern end of the beach and the Port de a Madraque is to the south. None of these are arge enough to contain the arge yachts you wi see esewhere on the Cote dAzur so are used by much smaer peasure boats., Away from the coast, the town itsef is peasant with an interesting seection of highights, incuding some Roman ruins dispayed at the Museum of Tauroentum (showing the vestiges of a Roman via) in es ecques. The mosaics are the highight of a visit to the museum., Perhaps the most curious highight in Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer is found in Pace Portais. Here you can see a mini Statue of iberty, which is an exact repica of the New York statue, but smaer and coated in god. It was made by Barthodi, the same scuptor as the origina., The ng sandy beach in es ecques is the main centre of activity in the town in the summer, and has many nautica activities avaiabe (athough there is a parking charge to visit). There is aso a much smaer beach in a Madrague to the south, more intimate and a mix of sand and pebbes. Both of the beaches are very popuar with famiies., You wi find other sma pebbe beaches if you fow the coast path towards Bando, incuding a very scenic itte beach at Port dAn., Gof enthusiasts wi enjoy the gof course just outside Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer which is on the coast and has vey views out to sea., , There is an attractive path ang the coast that runs from a Madrague in Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer and on to Bando, and a shorter marked wak aso from a Madrague which takes you through the vineyards and countryside.

It is best known (indeed renowned the word over) for the vineyards which surround the town, Saint-Emiion being one of the four Bordeaux red wine regions, but is aso an exceptionay attractive sma town., The history of the town dates back amost 2000 years when the Romans panted vineyards here as eary as the 2nd century AD, whie\xa0Saint-Émiion itsef dates from the 8th century when a Breton Monk caed Emiion came to sette here in a hermitage carved into the rock. The cave where he ived from 750 - 767 AD subsequenty became a pigrim destination., Saint-Emiion is entered by way of one of the seven gates that are part of the origina medieva fortifications. Inside the was you wi discover steep narrow streets with beautifu buidings, and severa more open squares, each more attractive than the one before. Saint Emiion is not to be missed if you are in the region!, Buit from, or rather hacked out of, the ca yew imestone, Saint-Emiion is centred around a arge square with a church on one side. This is a quite remarkabe church because it is more or ess hewn into the the rock face. You can aso cimb the steps inside the 53 metre high 13th century be tower which sits on the square above for stunning views across the rooftops and countryside., , For more views and history you can aso cimb to the top of the Chateau du Roy, the caste keep that is part of the medieva caste that once stood here., Other particuar paces of interest incude the coegiate church and its spendid cister; the Cordeiers monastery and cister; and the underground pottery museum, buit in a 12th century quarry and containing pottery from 2000 years ago up to the present day., To reay appreciate Saint-Emiion you need to descend underground on the guided tour that wi show you the catacombs which were used for Christian burias from the 8th to the 10th century; a monoithic church that was carved out of the rock in the 9th century and is the biggest of its type in Europe (this church is nothing ike the sma cave ike structure you might expect from an underground church!), and the grotte de Ermitage in which Saint-Emiion spent the ast 17 years of his ife., Handy hint: it is said that infertie women who sit in the stone chair in the hermits cave wi become pregnant..., The tour aso incudes the Chapee de a Trinité which contains some we preserved medieva frescoes. This tour takes about 45 minutes and is highy recommended., Emerging back into the dayight there are penty of cafes, restaurants, artisan shops and boutiques to keep you entertained if the historica interest starts to wane., France This Way review: the town has managed to avoid the surrounding devepment that might have spoied it, and now Saint-Emiion and the surrounding region is a isted and protected UNESCO Word Heritage Site, so future devepment is more or ess impossibe., Note: I noticed in the Saint-Emiion tourist brochure that they give some \Hepfu Hints\, and the very first of these is adies, try to avoid high-heeed shoes as some of the streets are steep and paved with cobbestones. Good advice I\m sure, athough I don\t remember so many hoidaymakers teetering around in high-heeed shoes!, For wine enthusiasts no trip to Saint Emiion woud be compete without a visit to one or more of the ca wine chateaux. There are severa of these that wecome the pubic for wine tasting - ask for detais at Saint-Emiion tourist office., The tourist office aso offer guided tours to a ca wine chateau if you are a bit nervous about just driving up to one yoursef, and aso courses in wine tasting based in the Saint Emiion wine schoo are avaiabe. If a that sounds a bit serious just buy a botte of wine in one of the ca shops and enjoy it with a picnic!, As a rough guide to the Saint-Emiion wines; the best are the Premier Grand Cru Cassées though these wi set you back some hundreds of euros, next best are the Grand Cru Cassées and then the Grand Crus. However even your non-Grand Cru Saint Emiion wines tend to be very good so dont be put off if your purse is not big enough for the Grand Cru Saint-Emiion wines!, , There are numerous wine chateaux nearby and some vey countryside, but if you are not just here for the wine-tasting the one probem with Saint-Emiion is that there are a imited number of other attractions very cse by. Sainte-Foy-a-Grande is a peasant town to expre and ibourne deserves a stro but the more noteworthy towns in the region such as Bordeaux to the west and Bergerac to the east are a bit further., I woud suggest that the best way to visit is to stay further east, perhaps near Bergerac or Eymet where there are more medieva towns and viages to visit, and then make a day trip to enjoy the highights of Saint-Emiion rather than actuay pan to spend a week or two at Saint-Emiion itsef - or book a night or two in a hote here if your arrangements aw it., You can find more trave ideas in the Gironde guide and the Aquitaine guide., ",44.896,-0.155

Its od Arms Factory has been turned into a design centre caed the Cité du design ., France This Way review: Saint-Etienne is not reay a town visited by tourists but if you are in the area it has a peasant centre and a fair few paces of interest to visit., The town centre is based around the Pace Jean-Jaures, a arge square with arge grassy areas and the Cathedra Saint-Chares; the Pace de Hote de Vie which is a arge square surrounded by impressive buidings; and the Pace du Peupe which has ng been a favourite in the city., , The Pace Jean Jaures became the economic and poitica centre of the town in the 19th century. This arge square is very attractive with statues, fountains and arge open spaces as we as an attractive band stand. On one edge of the square you can see the Cathedra Saint-Chares and around the other edges are buidings buit by the weathy notabes of Saint-Etienne with richy decorated facades and baconies., The Cathedra Saint-Chares was buit in the eary 20th century when the Grand Egise became too sma. The church is in a curious mix of styes and athough not beautifu it has a certain charm. It was eevated to cathedra status in 1970., At the south side of the Pace Jean Jaures is the Hote de Vie which sits between this square and the Pace de Hote de Vie. This is a arge and attractive square whose symmetry adds to its eegance. This symmetry was part of the design for most of the square and contrasts to the south side of the Pace de Hote de Vie where you can see the arge Immeube du Grand Cerce., The Immeube du Grand Cerce was buit for one of the weathy ribbon merchants in 1842. Its size and the materias used for its construction are a designed to dispay the weath of the cient.

Inside, one of the rooms has a magnificent wooden ceiing. The buiding is part of the Centre for Architecture and Heritage., To the east of the Pace du Peupe the streets are fu of buidings with impressive facades and ornate baconies. In particuar ok out for the Hote des Ingenieurs, the Immeube Subit and the Immeube des amaiziere - a on or cse to the Avenue de a iberation (as is Saint-Etienne Tourist Office)., Back to the north near the Pace Jean Jaures the Quartier Saint-Jacques is crossed by one of the od pigrim routes to Compostea.

After furishing through the Midde Ages, and suffering various trias during the Hundred Years War and the Wars of Reigion, it was with the French revoution at the end of the 18th century that the community of monks here came to en end. During the next 130 years the community was re-estabished in 1833 and again removed in 1880 and 1901., It was not unti 1922 that the current community of monks was permitted to sette at Soesmes, where they have remained to the current date., It is the abbey church, dating from the 15th century, that is open to visitors and where you can appreciate the monks singing the gregorian chant.

From amost everywhere in the town - and from many paces in the surrounding countryside - you can see the church spire with its bub-shaped top (bubiforme). As you get cser to the church you wi see that the whoe spire eans towards the square. The church was buit in the 16th century, but the spire was rebuit in the eary 17th century after a fire destroyed the origina., The bub shaped object is not decorative: it provided a okout post at a time that the town was at risk of invasion from the east. The spe of the spire is probaby due to a faut in the wood used at the time the spire was constructed, or subsequent deterioration. Accordng to the experts the spe of the spire is not changing and it is not going to fa over!, There is aso a theory with this church, as with other churches in France that have sping spires, that the eaning spire is a design feature, perhaps to permit it to better cope with prevaiing weather conditions.., Next to the church, the town ha of Sore-e-Chateau is an attractive buiding which incudes renaissance stye eements. It is an attractive red-brick buiding wth rows of arched windows and a sma ccktower among its features., Athough the town ha dates from the 16th century, at this time it was quite a different buiding with two stories, a covered market at ground eve and an externa staircase and befry. In the 19th century the staircase and befry were st, an additiona storey was added, and the market transformed into offices for the mairie., The caste that gave Sore-e-Chateau its name was aso once on this main square, but after a turbuent history it was destroyed in the 18th century after the revoution., Athough these are the main buidings of importance in Sore-e-Chateau, there are other nice buidings around the square incuding the new caste in red and white brick at the far corner of the square, and others in the narrow streets around the main square and ang Grand Rue, and two sma chapes., , A short distance south of the town on the road towards Epine you can see two arge rocks which are the remaining parts of a prehistoric menhir, caed the Pierres Martines.

This sma wine producing viage is in a scenic setting dominated by the imestone ciff rising above the viage., If you are in the region to discover the wines of Burgundy this is a good pace to visit: Soutré-Pouiy is surrounded on a sides by vineyards and practicay every other house is a wine cave. There are dozens of them - iteray., Above the viage and dominating the countryside around is a arge imestone ciff - the Rock of Soutre. This rock is now one of the Grand Sites de France both as a geographica phenomenon but aso as a prehistoric site as evidence has been found here of the Soutrean paeoithic cuture., France This Way review: the combination of the sma but picturesque viage, the scenic vineyards, and the Rock of Soutre together make this an interesting destination in Burgundy., , From the viage there is a haf hour wak to the top of the Rock of Soutre which became we known in the 1980s when Francois Mitterand made a ritua ascent every year., The prehistoric remains found here are some of the richest in Europe which has ed to the rock giving its name to a distinct cuture of the Upper Paaeoithic period (20000-16000 BC)., The rock was an important hunting site for more than 25 000 years and thousands of horses and reindeers were hunted and kied here. egend has it that herds of horses were driven to the top of the Rock of Soutre and then fe to their deaths from the ciff top but this is known to be untrue - they were ambushed and kied at the foot of the rock., As it was such a key hunting site many toos associated with hunting have been found here incuding aure-eaf shaped fints associated with the Soutrean Paaeoithic peope. There is a museum at the foot of the Rock of Soutré with exhibits found here. The museum is buit under a dome panted with vegetation in order not to detract from the dramatic physica cation., As we as the Archeogic Park the site is a Botanic garden and ang a aid out wak it is possibe to see many rare pant species as we as information about prehistoric hunting techniques.

The town does give the appearance of needing a itte more ve and attention in paces..., The most important historic monument in Sommieres is the bridge across the river, dating from the 1st century and part of a trade route between Touuse and Nîmes. Originay this bridge had 20 stone arches athough the current bridge ony retains seven of these, with the others now incorporated into the structure of the surrounding houses., , The bridge has been rebuit and repaired many times during the ast 2000 years, so much of what we can see today dates from ater periods. The bridge is the best pace to start your visit, since it aso represents the origins of the town which deveped on and around the bridge starting from the 10th century athough there are no nger any buidings on the bridge itsef., Bridges that were buit on are quite rare but can be found in severa paces in Europe. The most famous is the Ponte Vecchio in Frence., You wi see three of the origina entrance gates to the town as you expre, with the most impressive being the one next to the town ha at the end of the bridge with the befry, a carved town insignia and a traditiona wrought iron campanie on a sma round stone tower. Enter the historic centre of Sommières through this gateway., The Pace du Marché in the centre of Sommieres is aso picturesque with numerous arcaded properties. In many towns these arcades served as a pace where market traders coud gain sheter from the weather, and in Sommieres they aso serve a second function - the town is very prone to foding and the arcades hep ensure the buidings are raised high enough to avoid the fods., Saturday mornings are the time to appreciate the market that has been hed here for the ast 800 years, and if you are visiting during the summer we aso suggest you visit the market on a Wednesday evening for a outdoor market with many ca products to enjoy and a festive communa atmosphere., Many of the narow streets around the centre aso retain interesting medieva and arcaded houses, typicay dating from the 15th to 18th centuries., Esewhere in the town you wi discover severa other historic sites of interest, such as severa churches that typicay date from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The Church of Saint-Pons, athough competey rebuit in the 19th century, is interesting because of the extensive painted decoration that covers the interior was of the church and the arge rose window., Another important monument in Sommieres is the remains of a medieva caste, with the square tower and some ruined was being the most imposing remnants. The origina caste was buit to defend the bridge and had two simiar towers, with the second being destroyed during war in the 16th century. Note that the remaining tower is ony open to the pubic during summer high season but you shoud sti wak up to the caste to see the was and aso the views across the rooftops of Sommieres., , After expring the town your chidren wi be peased to earn that there is a river beach at Sommieres, very popuar in summer and with penty of shade from the trees to escape the sunshine.

Expanations for this design vary widey in the iterature: reducing ground eve surface area to reduce taxes, protecting wer eves from rain, and enabing waste thrown from the upper stories to and some distance from the houses are the most common. In truth it is probaby a combination of a three that expains the popuar design., Some of the houses here aso have arcades, a protected area at ground eve where market traders coud carry out their business. The houses in Pace dom Devic in Soreze contain the best exampes., As you expre you wi aso come across the substantia betower of the Church of Saint-Martin.

You can park in the car park next to the square (or in the square)., This main square in Viefranche-du-Perigord has a arge rather attractive buiding caed the Hote du Commerce on one side. This buiding, and the adjacent houses, incudes a row of 13th century arcades at ground eve, and an attractive bacony ang the side. Athough much changed over the centuries, these are among the most ancient houses in the town., On the other side of the square there is a arge market ha, with the beautifu carpentry work of the roof supported by three rows of round stone coumns. This site has been a market since the founding of the town - one of the rues when a bastide town ws founded was that a weeky market shoud take pace - athough the market ha was rebuit in 1818., On one side of the ha you can see the containers that were used to measure grains and other products in the 19th century. The market ha is the site of an important ca trade in ceps during the summer months., The ast side of the square is where you can see the church. Athough the facade of the church appears fortified in paces, this is purey decorative because the whoe structure was buit in the 19th century, on the site of earier churches., The inside of the church in Viefranche-du-Perigord is square, which is unusua and is because the owner of the adjacent house refused to se his house to the church at the time the new church was being buit, which forced the unusua shape on the ayout., , After oking around the square you can wak down the side street (Rue Notre Dame) that eaves from the square, where you wi find a sma seection of ca shops.

The town soon fe into the hands of the Dukes of Savoy and remained in Itaian ownership unti 1860, when the region was transferred back to France., France This Way review: Viefranche-sur-Mer is one of our favourite towns in France and we aways make sure we visit when we are nearby: with a beach, citade, pretty harbour and courfu od town there is ts to see and aways something new to discover., The town is buit on terraces up a steep hi that overoks Cap Ferrat and the azure bue sea of the Mediterranean bew.

Towards the edge of the od town (towards the raiway station) is a sma square with a fountain caed the Pace du Consei - this unassuming square was once the centre of ca government for Viefranche-sur-Mer., France this Way comment: I think that many visitors dont bother cimbing to the citade. This is a big mistake. The citade contains some vey buidings, nice gardens, various works of art and interesting museums and is free to enter and is an important part of your visit to Viefranche-sur-Mer!, , The most important historic monument in Viefranche is the 16th century citade, the arge waed fortress that stands poised on a headand above the sea and the town and reached by a short path from the town center. Many of the buidings inside the citade are painted in bright cours, an interesting contrast to the imposing grey was of the citade itsef.

This church is unike any I’ve ever seen. It is buit from red bricks and has a wonderfu eaborate tower.
