Teguise is about 20lm inland of the popular resort of Costa Teguise on the south east coast of Lanzarote.', 'Teguise is a sleepy town whose history as the islands capital until 1852 can be seen in its palaces and stately homes and wide, cobbled strreets. The town was declared an architecturally historic site in 1980.', 'Above the town of Teguise, on the Guanapay volcano, is a 16th century castle, the Castillo de Santa Barbara, which was built to protect Teguise against the pirates who were a menace in the seas around the Canary Islands at this time. In the 17th century its size and fortifications were increased. The castle is now a museum dedicated to the Canary emigration to the Americas.', 'Other evidence of the pirates in Teguise is the street called Calle de la Sangre or Street of Blood!', 'In the town the Palicio Spinola is open for visitors. Its exterior is very simple, a long, white rectangular building. Inside the style is still simple but really very elegant with its polished wooden floors, dark wooden doors and window frames and white walls. The Palacio Spinola was the home of the Governor of Lanzarote in the 18th century.', 'The Iglesia de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe is on the main square of Teguise. It is very attractive with its simple white structure with an attached red and black brick tower with a Moorish-looking bell tower on the top.', 'Two other religious buildings are worth visiting. These are the Convent of Santo Domingo and the Convent of San Fransisco. The Convent of Santo Domingo is beautifully simple inside with white walls and four arches built in red and black bricks. It is now home to a contemporary art gallery. The Convent of San Fransisco is Baroque in style and houses a museum of Religious Art.', 'A good day to visit Teguise is Sunday when there is a busy market and craft fair with folk dancing.', 'Of course most visitors to Teguise will be holidaying at the popular nearby resort of Costa Tequise. If you are not then the resort is worth visiting. The resort was designed by Cesar Manrique, a Lanzarote-born artist who has been instrumental in developing Lanzarote as a tourist destination but in making sure that developments are subject to strict planning regulations.', 'Cesar Manrique was an artist and you can visit his house-museum, the Casa Museo del Campesino just outside San-Bartolomé. As well as various artworks there is an underground volcanic cave that has been converted into a restaruant. There are various other Cesar Manrique installations across the island of Lanzarote.', 'Haria and the Valley of the Thousand Palms are nearby.

These volcanoes are known as the Fire Mountains (Montanas de Fuego) and are one of the most important parts of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve which covers the whole of Lanzarote. The Fire Mountains are in the Timanfaya National Park which has been set up to protect this unique area.', 'When the volcanoes erupted nearly half of the inhabitants of Lanzarote ended up having to leave and most of the arable land of Lanzarote was covered by the lava crust. Luckily no-one was killed by mountains appeared overnight, earthquakes shook the island and lava and hot ash covered much of the island. More than 100 volcanoes were involved in this cataclysmic event!', 'The entrance to the park is near the village of Yaiza. Once in the park you can take a short camel ride up one of the volcanic slopes for views across the parks. There are parts of the park that you can drive through to view the eerie alien landscape up close.', 'Then when you get to Islote de Hilario you can take a coach trip around parts of the park inacessible to cars (the price is included in the entrance fee). Guides at Islote de Hilario demonstate that one of the volcanoes, the Timanfaya volcano is far from extint. Branches pushed into crevises burst into flames and water poured into boreholes errupts as steam. Touch the ground and it still feels hot!', 'There is also a restaurant, the El Diablo restaurant, with fabulous views over the park. Cooking at the restaurant is done using the heat of the volcano - a cast iron grill is placed over a hole in the ground! Food is typical Canary cuisine.\\xa0 Views are spectacular from the restaurant, especially at sunset. All in all quite an experience!', 'There are a couple of walks that you can do in the park, these are guided walks and you need to book in advance.', 'The route around the volcano park was determined by a local artist César Manrique and he also designed the El Diablo restaurant.', \"Puerto del Carmen is Lanzarote's most popular seaside resort and has some great beaches.

Indeed it is so close that back in the 1700s when the volcanoes were very active Yaiza lay directly in the path of the lava. Many neighbouring towns were consumed by the lava but as it approached Zaiza the lava flow split. One stream went towards Uga and the other towards Playa Blanca. Zaiza, in the middle escaped unharmed.', '', 'Yaiza sits amid this weird luna landscape and its white-washed buildings and pretty squares are little changed since the days it escaped the volcanoes. Its church, the Nuestro Senora de los Remedios dates back to the 17th century and contains a statue of the Madonna which is reputed to sometimes be lit by a strange blue glow.', 'Residents of Yaiza have planted their streets with colourful displays and set against the white buildings and volcanic scenery the effect is very attractive.So much so that Yaitza has won a \"prettiest village in Spain\" accolade a couple of times.', 'At Christmas time Yaiza sets up a large \"Belen\" or Nativity scene, with miniatures of different places around Lanzarote island including Playa Blanca, Timanfaya and Arrecife.
